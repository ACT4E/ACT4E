# Normal Usage

Here are more specific instructions intended for who has never used 
LaTeX before. Feel free to e-mail the author of this template to ask for 
clarifications. Also check out the instructions on how to set up your 
own ShareLaTeX server, if you want.

## Usage with Overleaf

## Usage on your local machine

1. Download a TeX distribution for your computer (linux, windows or 
   mac); see https://www.latex-project.org/get/.

1. Download the kaobook repository from github (or from overleaf).

1. Write your own content. You can either modify the existing files from 
   the `examples` directory or start from scratch.

1. From the command line, run "pdflatex main.tex" to compile the pdf. 
   Otherwise, install a LaTeX editor such as TeXStudio and follow the 
   specific instructions to compile your document.

1. Fix the errors that will inevitably appear; a wise move is to search 
   google for the error message you obtained.

1. Write more content, compile again, and solve the new errors. Do this 
   until your book is done.
