\noindent
Exam date: 27.08.2021 \\
Exam time: 10:00 -- 11:30  (1.5 hours) \\ 
Exam place: HG E 7 \\
Allowed materials: open book (laptops, phones, internet?)

\

\noindent
Aims of the exam: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Test familiarity with and understanding of basic definitions from the course
\item Test proficiency in basic mathematical skills relating to proving statements, reasoning, and problem-solving
\item Test the understanding of interconnections between various concepts introduced in the course, and the ability to transfer knowledge
\item Test the understanding of the "compositional way of thinking" and the use of category theory concepts in connection with applied examples
\end{enumerate}

\

\noindent
Desired properties of the exam: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Have more questions than are expected by any average or slightly above average student to be solved in the given 1.5 hours (we can then grade on a curve), in order to account for uncertainty in how difficult we judge the exam to be. 
\item On the other hand we should not have too too many questions, because otherwise the grading work will be disproportionally large in proportion to the number of students. 
\item Include some multiple choice questions as a way to provide students with a quick means to gain points and to reduce correction work. 
\item Include some problems that ask for mathematical proofs. 
\item Include some problems that have an applied flavor. 
\item Include at least one problem that is challenging and requires some creative problem solving. 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Draft Exam 1}



\begin{gradedexercise}
(7 points) Let $\CatC$ denote the category of real vector spaces. Given real vector spaces $\Obja = (V_1, +_1, \cdot_1)$ and $\Objb = (V_2, +_2, \cdot_2)$, we define their \emph{direct sum} $\Obja \oplus \Objb$ as follows. 
The underlying set of $\Obja \oplus \Objb$ is the cartesian product of the underlying sets of $\Obja$ and $\Objb$, namely $V_1 \times V_2$. For $\Obja \oplus \Objb$, vector addition is defined (using infix notation) by
$$(\ela_1, \ela_2) + (\elb_1, \elb_2) := (\ela_1 +_1 \elb_1, \ela_2 +_2 \elb_2) \quad \quad \ela_1, \elb_1 \in V_1; \ \ela_2, \elb_2 \in V_2;$$
and scalar multiplication is defined (using infix notation) by
$$\lambda \cdot (\ela_1, \ela_2) := (\lambda \cdot_1 \ela_1, \lambda \cdot_2 \ela_2), \quad \quad \lambda \in \reals; \ \ela_1 \in V_2; \ \ela_2 \in V_2.$$

Prove that the direct sum of real vector spaces -- together with inclusion morphisms which you should specify -- is ``the'' categorical coproduct in the category $\CatC$. 
\end{gradedexercise}




\begin{gradedexercise}
Let $\Set$ denote the category of sets and $\powerset : \Set \to \Set$ the powerset functor which assigns, to any given set $\setA$, the set of subsets of $\setA$. The endofunctor $\powerset$ may be equipped with the structure of a monad $(\powerset, \eta, \mu)$, where the components of the natural transformations $\eta$ and $\mu$ are given, respectively, by the functions
$$ \eta_{\setA} : \setA \to \powerset \setA, \ \ela \mapsto \{ \ela \}$$
and
$$ \mu_{\setA} : \powerset \powerset \setA \to \powerset \setA, \ \sigma \mapsto \bigcup_{S \in \sigma} S.$$

\begin{enumerate}
\item (2 points) Prove that $\eta$, as defined above, is in fact a natural transformation. 
\item Let $\Set_{\powerset}$ denote the Kleisli category of the monad $(\powerset, \eta, \mu)$. The aim of this part of the exercise is to show that the category $\Set_{\powerset}$ and the category $\Rel$ of sets and relations are isomorphic as categories. Your tasks are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item (8 points) Define functors $F: \Set_{\powerset} \to \Rel$ and $G: \Rel \to \Set_{\powerset} $ and prove that they are in fact functors. 
\item (3 points) Prove that $F$ is an isomorphism of categories, with inverse $G$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\end{gradedexercise}

\section*{Draft Exam 2}

\begin{gradedexercise}
(6 points) Here is a list of some posets. Which of them are lattices? 
Please give yes/no answers, and additionally, in the case of a "no", state all reasons why the poset in question fails to be a lattice. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The poset given by the real numbers $\reals$ equipped with the usual ordering. 
\item The poset given by the set $\setA = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}$ equipped with the ordering given by divisibility. That means, for all $\ela, \elb \in \setA$: $\ela \leq \elb$ if and only if $\ela$ divides $\elb.$ 
\item The poset given by the set $\{ \subA \subseteq \{1, 2 , 3 \} \mid 3 \notin \subA \}$, equipped with the ordering given by inclusion of subsets. 
\item Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional real vector space. Consider the poset given by the set $\mathcal{S}$ of linear subspaces of $V$, equipped with the ordering given by inclusion of subspaces. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{gradedexercise}

\begin{gradedexercise}
Let $\Rel$ denote the category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are binary relations. Given sets $\setA$ and $\setB$, we define their disjoint union to be the set
$$
\setA + \setB := \{ \tup{\ela, 1} \mid \ela \in \setA \} \cup \{ \tup{\elb, 2} \mid \elb \in \setB \}.
$$

Prove that in $\Rel$, the disjoint union -- together with projection morphisms which you should specify -- is ``the'' categorical product. 
\end{gradedexercise}


\begin{gradedexercise}[\exname{ProbFunc}]\label{ex:ProbFunc}
Let $\Set$ denote the category of sets and functions. 
Given a set $\setA$, let $\mathcal{P} \setA$ denote the set of functions $p: \setA \to [0,1]$ which 
\begin{itemize}
\item take a non-zero value at only finitely-many elements of $\setA$, and 
\item satisfy the equation $\sum_{\ela \in \setA} p(\ela) = 1$. 
\end{itemize}
We think of $\mathcal{P} \setA$ as the set of finitely supported probability measures on $\setA$, or, in other words, the set of ``finite normalized histograms over the elements of $\setA$''. 

Given a function $\mapa: \setA \to \setB$ between sets, let $\mathcal{P} \mapa: \mathcal{P}\setA \to \mathcal{P}\setB$ be the function defined by 
$$ (\mathcal{P} \mapa)(p)(\elb) = \sum_{\ela \in \mora^{-1}(\{ \elb \})} p(\ela) \quad \quad  p \in \mathcal{P}\setA, \  \elb \in \setB.$$

Prove that the above defines a functor $\mathcal{P}: \Set \to \Set$. 

Remark: you do not need to prove that, given $p \in \mathcal{P}\setA$, the function $(\mathcal{P} \mapa)(p)$ is indeed an element of $\mathcal{P}\setB$; you can assume this fact to be true. 
\end{gradedexercise}

\begin{gradedexercise}[\exname{ProbNatTrafos}]\label{ex:ProbNatTrafos}
Let $\Set$ be the category of sets, let $\mathbf{Id}_\Set : \Set \to \Set$ be the identity functor, and let $\mathcal{P}: \Set \to \Set$ be the functor defined in \cref{ex:ProbFunc}. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given a set $\setA$, let $\delta_{\setA} : \setA \to \mathcal{P} \setA$ be the function defined by
$$\delta_\setA (\ela)(\elb) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
        1 & \text{if } \elb = \ela \\
        0 & \text{else.} 
        \end{array}\right. 
  \quad \quad \ela, \elb \in \setA.$$
Prove that the collection of functions $\{ \delta_{\setA} \}_{\setA \in \Ob_{\Set}}$ defines a natural transformation $\delta: \mathbf{Id}_\Set \Rightarrow \mathcal{P}$. 
\item Given a set $\setA$, let $\mu_\setA : \mathcal{P} \mathcal{P} \setA \to \mathcal{P} \setA$ be the function defined by 
$$\mu_\setA (f)(\ela) = \sum_{p \in \mathcal{P} \setA} f(p) p(\ela) \quad \quad f \in \mathcal{P} \mathcal{P} \setA, \ela \in \setA.$$
Prove that the collection of functions $\{ \mu_{\setA} \}_{\setA \in \Ob_{\Set}}$ defines a natural transformation $\mu: \mathcal{P} \mathcal{P} \Rightarrow \mathcal{P}$. 

\end{enumerate}
\end{gradedexercise}

\begin{gradedexercise}
Let $\Set$ denote the category of sets, and let $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathbf{Id}_\Set$, $\delta$, and $\mu$ be as in \cref{ex:ProbFunc} and \cref{ex:ProbNatTrafos}. 
Prove that $\tup{\mathcal{P}, \mu, \delta}$ defines a monad on $\Set$.
