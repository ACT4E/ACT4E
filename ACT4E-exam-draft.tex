\section*{Meta}

\noindent
Exam date: 27.08.2021 \\
Exam time: 10:00 -- 11:30  (1.5 hours) \\ 
Exam place: HG E 7 \\
Allowed materials: open book (laptops, phones, internet?)

\

\noindent
Aims of the exam: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Test familiarity with and understanding of basic definitions from the course
\item Test proficiency in basic mathematical skills relating to proving statements, reasoning, and problem-solving
\item Test the understanding of interconnections between various concepts introduced in the course, and the ability to transfer knowledge
\item Test the understanding of the "compositional way of thinking" and the use of category theory concepts in connection with applied examples
\end{enumerate}

\

\noindent
Desired properties of the exam: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Have more questions than are expected by any average or slightly above average student to be solved in the given 1.5 hours (we can then grade on a curve), in order to account for uncertainty in how difficult we judge the exam to be. 
\item On the other hand we should not have too too many questions, because otherwise the grading work will be disproportionally large in proportion to the number of students. 
\item Include some multiple choice questions as a way to provide students with a quick means to gain points and to reduce correction work. 
\item Include some problems that ask for mathematical proofs. 
\item Include some problems that have an applied flavor. 
\item Include at least one problem that is challenging and requires some creative problem solving. 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Definition verification questions}

\begin{gradedexercise}
Let $(P, \leq)$ be a poset. Explain how $(P, \leq)$ can be viewed as a category, and prove that, in this interpretation, it satisfies the definition of a category. 
\end{gradedexercise}


\begin{gradedexercise}
Let $(M, ;, 1)$ be a monoid. Explain how $(M, ;, 1)$ can be viewed as a category, and prove that, in this interpretation, it satisfies the definition of a category. 
\end{gradedexercise}

\begin{gradedexercise}
Check that XYZ is a monad (use an example from Paolo's notes?)
\end{gradedexercise}

\begin{gradedexercise}
Check that the Kleisli category of a monad is indeed a category... (do this generically or using a concrete example?)
\end{gradedexercise}

\begin{gradedexercise}
Check that the Eilenberg Moore category of a monad is indeed a category...  (do this generically or using a concrete example?)
\end{gradedexercise}

\section*{Reformulation/definition questions}

\begin{gradedexercise}
Something about monoid or group actions... maybe proving that the ``traditional definition'' is equivalent to one that involves the concept of ``functor''
\end{gradedexercise}
