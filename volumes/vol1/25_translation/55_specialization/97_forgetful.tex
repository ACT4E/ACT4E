}

\begin{example}
    The \SY{functor}~$\Pos \fto \Set$ is a forgetful \SY{functor}.
    This \SY{functor} maps every \SY{poset} to the set which has the same elements, but no notion of order.
    Furthermore, it maps each \SY{monotone map} between \SY{posets} to the corresponding function between sets.
    This is a forgetful \SY{functor} in the sense that it forgets the notion of order and \SY{monotone maps}.
\end{example}
