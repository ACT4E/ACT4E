\chaptersecond{Specialization}{chapter-swissguard}{}{
    Oftentimes, two categories are in a special relation: one is a specialization of the other.
    There are two interesting situations.

    First, a category can be a \emph{subcategory} of another if it contains a subset of the objects and morphisms of the other, in such a way that it is closed to composition.

    Second, there is a generalization called \emph{embedding}: objects and morphisms are different, but we can find a functor that ``draws'' the first category in the second.
