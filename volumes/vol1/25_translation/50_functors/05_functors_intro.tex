\section{Modeling translations}

We can think of a given category \CatC as a ``compositional world'': inside of \CatC we have objects, morphisms between them, and a way to talk about composing morphisms.
Now we will zoom out a level, and consider different categories -- different worlds -- simultaneously, and how to relate them to each other.

The most basic notion of how to ``map'' one category to another is given by the concept of a \emph{functor}.
