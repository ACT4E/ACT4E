\section{Categorical Databases}
\label{sec:functors-categorical-db}

In this section we look at how a relational database can be modeled using the notion of \SY{functors}.
This view of databases is due to Spivak~\cite{spivak2019categorical,spivak2012ologs,}.

To model a database, we need to model two things:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The \emph{schema} of the database is its structure.
          This includes which tables are present,
          what fields are included in each table, and what constraints there are among tables.
    \item The \emph{data} that resides in the database.
\end{enumerate}

Spivak's idea is that categories can be used for modeling the schema, not the data.
The data can be modeled as a \emph{functor}.
