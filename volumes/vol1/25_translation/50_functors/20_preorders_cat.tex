\section{A poset as a category}
\label{sec:posetsarecats}
A single poset~$\tup{\posA, \posleq}$ can be described as a category, in which each point is an object, and there is a morphism between two objects~$\posela$ and~$\posela$ if and only if~$\posela \posAleq \poselb$. This is a ``thin'' category, wich means that there is at most one morphism
between two objects. For any~$\posela,\poselb\in \posA$, there exist only one relation~$\posela\posAleq \poselb$ in~$\posA$ (\cref{def:poset}). The identity morphism is given by the reflexivity property of posets: for any~$\posela\in \posA$, we have~$\posela \posAleq \posela$. Furthermore, composition is given by the transitivity property of posets: for~$\posela,\poselb,\poselc \in \posA$,~$\posela\posAleq \poselb$ and~$\poselb\posAleq \poselc$ implies~$\posela\posAleq \poselc$.

\begin{example}
  Let's revisit \cref{ex:hasseinclusion}, in which we had a poset~$\powerset{\left(\{a,b,c\}\right)}$ with order given by inclusion (\cref{fig:posetascat}).

    \caption{Power set~$\powerset{\{a,b,c\}}$ as a category. \label{fig:posetascat}}
  \end{marginfigure}

  This is a category~\CatC, with~$\ObC=\powerset\left(\{a,b,c\}\right)$, and morphisms given by the inclusions. Note that we omit to draw self-arrows for the identity morphisms. Composition is given by the transitivity law of posets. For instance, since~$\{a\}\subseteq \{a,b\}$ and~$\{a,b\} \subseteq \{a,b,c\}$, we can say that~$\{a\}\subseteq \{a,b,c\}$.
\end{example}

\subsection{Monotone maps are functors}
Note that morphisms in \Pos are morphisms between posets, and we have just discovered that posets are examples of categories.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:posetfunctor}
  A monotone map~$\funa$ between posets~$\posA,\posB$ is a functor between the ``posetal categories''~$\posA$ and~$\posB$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We start by specifying the functor~$\funa$ and two posets~$\posA$ and~$\posB$. We first specify the action of~$\funa$ on objects (elements of a poset) and on morphisms (order relations). A monotone function maps each element of a poset~$\posela\in \posA$ to~$\funa(\posela) \in \posB$, and it guarantees that for every~$\posela,\poselb\in \posA$, if $\posela\posAleq \poselb$ then~$\funa(\posela)\posBleq \funa(\poselb)$. We now need to check the two conditions that a functor must satisfy. First, consider the identity morphism for~$\posela\in \posA$, namely~$\posela \posAleq \posela$. The application of the map~$\funa$ results in the condition~$\funa(\posela)\posBleq \funa(\posela)$, which is the identity morphism on~$\posB$. Second, morphisms~$\posela\posAleq \poselb$ and~$\poselb\posleq \poselc$ in~$\posA$, by applying the map~$\funa$ to the morphism composition~$\posela\posAleq \poselc$ one obtains~$\funa(\posela)\posBleq \funa(\poselc)$, which is the same as the composition of~$\funa(\posela)\posBleq \funa(\poselb)$ and~$\funa(\poselb)\posBleq \funa(\poselc)$.
\end{proof}
