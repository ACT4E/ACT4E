  The \emph{Battle of Surfaces} was a men's tennis exhibition match that was held on May 2, 2007 between the Swiss Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, respectively
  number 1 and 2 in the world in men's singles. Federer preferred grass----he was 5 years unbeaten on that terrain. Nadal preferred clay---he was 3 years unbeaten.
  To check who would win when averaging out the terrain, the match was played on a unique court with a clay surface on one side of the net and grass on the other.
