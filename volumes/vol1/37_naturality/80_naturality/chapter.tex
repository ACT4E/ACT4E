    We have seen that functors are ``morphisms between categories''.
    It turns out that there is an important third layer to the world of categories: there are also ``morphisms between functors'', and these are known as \emph{natural transformations}.

    To represent the three layers of structure involved in the world of categories, it is common to draw diagrams like this:
    %
    \begin{figure}[h!
        ]
        \includesag{3-layer-diagrams}
        \label{fig:3-layer-diagrams}
    \end{figure}
    %
    points represent categories, single arrows represent functors, and double arrows represent natural transformations.
