    We have seen that \SY{functors} are ``morphisms between categories''.
    It turns out that there is an important third layer to the world of categories: there are also ``morphisms between \SY{functors}'', and these are known as \emph{natural transformations}.

    To represent the three layers of structure involved in the world of categories, it is common to draw diagrams like this:
    %
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \includesag{3-layer-diagrams}
        \label{fig:3-layer-diagrams}
    \end{figure}
    %
    Points represent categories, single arrows represent \SY{functors}, and double arrows represent \SY{natural transformations}.
