\section{Trade-offs}

\todo{Add the examples from session 6:}
Trade-offs characterize all engineering disciplines, and can be literally found everywhere. A typical trade-off is the one reported in \cref{fig:fast_good_cheap}. When designing a product, you want it to be \emph{good}, \emph{fast}, and \emph{cheap}, and typically you can just choose between two of these qualities.
