\section{Subsets}
Now consider the set~$\makeset{ \sapple, \scarrot, \sbanana }$, and compare it with~$\makeset{ \sapple, \scarrot, \sbanana, \stea }$.
Each of the elements of the first set is also an element of the second set;
in such a case we say that the first set is \emph{included} in the second set.
In symbols,
%
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:subset}
	\{ \sapple, \scarrot, \sbanana \} \subseteq \{ \sapple, \scarrot, \sbanana, \stea \}.
\end{equation}
%
Generally, given sets~$\setA$ and~$\setB$, the statement~$\setA \subseteq \setB$ is logically equivalent to the statement
%
\begin{equation*}
	\prfperiod{
		\ela \in \setA
	}{
		\ela \in \setB
	}
\end{equation*}

Returning to \cref{eq:subset}, the second set is, on the other hand, \emph{not} included in the first set, since~$\stea$ is an element of the second set, but not the first.
If we say a set is ``strictly included'' in another, then we mean ``included in and not equal'';
if the adjective ``strictly'' is not used, then inclusion means for us that equality is also possible.
\todotextjira{499}{@J: seems like a good place to introduce also $\subset$ - also compare with $<$, $\leq$.}
In other words, for us it is true that any set~$\setA$ is included in itself:~$\setA \subseteq \setA$.
Given sets~$\setA$ and~$\setB$, if it is the case that~$\setA \subseteq \setB$, then we say that~$\setA$ is a \emph{subset} of~$\setB$.
Inclusion and equality are related as follows: given sets~$\setA$ and~$\setB$,
%
\begin{equation*}
	\prfdoubleperiod{
		\setA = \setB
	}{
		{\setA \subseteq \setB}
		\quad
		{\setB \subseteq \setA}
	}
\end{equation*}
%
Equivalently, two sets are equal if they have the same elements:
\begin{equation*}
	\prfdoubleperiod{
		\quad \setA = \setB \quad
	}{
		\prfdouble{
			\ela \in \setA
		}{
			\ela \in \setB
		}
	}
\end{equation*}
