\section{A word on foundations}


\todotext{maybe we can give the reader a very very short overview and orientation of how set theory and type theory fit into foundations for mathematics and also how they relate to computation and computer science??}

Intro paragraph(s):
This section is to give the reader a very rough orientation... 


\subsection{Logic}

What is logic about?

\

What is a logical system or ``a logic''? 


\

Explain the terms formal system, formal language... 

\

Explain / mention the role of propositional logic and first-order propositional logic


\

Mention constructive mathematics? 

\subsection{Set theory}

Mention ZFC... 



\subsection{Type theory}


Explain the basic ideas ? or just say we'll get into it in the exercises part of the book? 

\


Explain here the rough role of category theory in the foundations story? 


\subsection{Computer science and computation}

Mention the links to CS and computation? 


\

Mention computational trinitarianism?
