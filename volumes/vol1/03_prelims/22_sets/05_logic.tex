\section{Logical preliminaries}

We assume the reader to have some familiarity with basic logical concepts and notation, in the way that they are typically used for reasoning and writing proofs in undergraduate mathematics. We recall the most basic notions, also to fix our notation. 

The building blocks for reasoning mathematically are logical statements (also called assertions, propositions, logical formulae, etc) which, in principle, may be evaluated to be either or true or false, depending on the situation and the assumptions made.  In particular, a statement might depend on variables, and the truth or falsity of the statement might vary depending on how these variables are evaluated. 

Deductive reasoning is based on logical implications: statements of the form ``if statement $P$ is true, then statement $Q$ is true" or, synonymously, ``$P$ implies $Q$". The statement ``$P$ implies $Q$" is abbreviated with the notation $P \Imp Q$. Here "$P \Imp Q$" is itself a statement that may be true or false. 

Besides implication, two very familiar logical operations are ``and'' and ``or'', usually denoted in infix notation by the symbols $\wedge$ and $\vee$, respectively. If $P$ and $Q$ are logical statements, then $P \wedge Q$ is the logical statement which is true precisely when both $P$ and $Q$ are true, and otherwise is false. And $P \vee Q$ is the logical statement that is true precisely when either $P$ or $Q$, or both, are true. 

An example of a compound statement (or formula) is the statement ``$(P \Imp Q) \wedge (Q \Imp P)$'', which is abbreviated with the notation ``$P \Eqv Q$''. When the statement $P \Eqv Q$ is true, we say that $P$ and $Q$ are \emph{equivalent} or that $P$ is true \emph{if and only if} $Q$ is true. 


Given a logical statement $P$, its negation $\lnot P$ is the statement that is true if and only if $P$ is false. 

The following symbols denote so-called `universal quantifiers'; they abbreviate the following meanings:
\begin{align}
\forall x &\quad \quad \text{``for all $x$''} \\
\exists x &\quad \quad \text{``there exists $x$''}
\end{align}
