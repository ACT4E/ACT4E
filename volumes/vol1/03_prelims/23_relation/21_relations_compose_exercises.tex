    Implement the composition of two relations.
}

\classlisting{FiniteRelationCompose}

Note here how Python typing is helping in expressing the intention.
The first relation is from \TypeVar{E1} to \TypeVar{E2}; the second relation is from \TypeVar{E2} to \TypeVar{E3}; consequently, the result is a relation from \TypeVar{E1} to \TypeVar{E3}.
