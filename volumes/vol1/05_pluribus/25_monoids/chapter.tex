  This chapter introduces three of the most basic algebra structures: semigroups, monoids, and groups.
}
\label{ch:monoids}

Oftentimes we are going to studies certain \emph{structures} and then their \emph{refinements}.
By \emph{refinement} we mean another type of structure that has additional properties/constraints.

The simplest structure that has to do with composition is that of a \emph{magma}: it just assumes that there is a set with a binary operation defined on it.

\begin{definition}[Magma]
  \label{def:magma}
  A \emph{\iindex{magma}}~$\sgrpA$ is a set~$\sgrpAset$, together with a binary operation
  \begin{equation}
    \mtimes  \colon \sgrpAset \cartprod \sgrpAset \sto \sgrpAset,
  \end{equation}
 \end{definition}

We can build more interesting structures by looking at the properties that such operation can have.
