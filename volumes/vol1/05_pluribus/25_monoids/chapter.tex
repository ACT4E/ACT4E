  This chapter introduces three of the most basic algebra structures: semigroups, monoids, and groups.
}
\label{ch:monoids}

Oftentimes we are going to studies certain \emph{structures} and then their \emph{refinements}.
By \emph{refinement} we mean another type of structure that has additional properties/constraints.

The simplest structure that has to do with composition is that of a \emph{magma}: it just assumes that there is a set with a binary operation defined on it.

\begin{definition}[Magma]
  \label{def:magma}
  A \emph{\iindex{magma}}~$\sgrpA$ is a set~$\sgrpAset$, together with a binary operation
  \begin{equation}
    \mtimes  \colon \sgrpAset \cartprod \sgrpAset \sto \sgrpAset.
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

Given a finite set $\setA$, one way to specify a composition operation~$\mtimes$ on $\setA$ is simply by writing out what it does with each pair of elements of~$\setA$.
Since~$\mtimes$ is a function of two variables, this can be conveniently displayed as a table, sometimes called a \emph{multiplication table} or a \emph{Cayley table}. We will use the name \emph{composition table}. Consider for example the set $\setA = \{ \ela, \elb \}$. A composition operation $\mtimes$ is specified in \cref{comp-table}. 
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Composition table.}
    \label{tab:comp-table}
    \begin{tabular}{c|cc}
      $\mtimes$ & $\ela$ & $\elb$ \\
      \hline
      \ela & \ela & \ela \\            
      \elb & \elb & \ela \\ 
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
We read it as saying
$$
\ela \mtimes \ela = \ela, \quad \ela \mtimes \elb = \ela, \quad \elb \mtimes \ela = \elb,  \quad \elb \mtimes \ela = \ela.
$$

Magmas are quite general and simplistic. We can build more interesting structures by considering, for example, properties that the composition operation might have.
