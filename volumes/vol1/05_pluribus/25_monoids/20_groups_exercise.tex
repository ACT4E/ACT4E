A \Group is a \Monoid that has an inverse \Mapping.

A \FiniteGroup is a particular case of \Group and \FiniteMonoid where the inverse is a \FiniteMap.

\begin{marginfigure}%
    \yamldatafile{G2_.group.yaml}{}
    \caption{Simple group $\{-1,+1\}$ with multiplication}%
    \label{fig:G2}%
\end{marginfigure}%

The file format for groups is a extension of the one for monoids (which was an extension of the one for semigroups).
There is an extra field \fieldname{inverse} which gives you the inverse map (\cref{fig:G2}).
