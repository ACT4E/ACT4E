\sectionexercises{Groups}

A \Group is a \Monoid that has an inverse \Mapping.

\classlisting{Group}{}

A \FiniteGroup is a particular case of \Group and \FiniteMonoid where the inverse is a \FiniteMap.

\subsubsection*{Representation}

\begin{marginfigure}%
    \datafile{G2_}{}
    \caption{Simple group $\makeset{-1,+1}$ with multiplication}%
    \label{fig:G2}%
\end{marginfigure}%

The file format for groups is an extension of the one for monoids (which was an extension of the one for semigroups).
There is an extra field \fieldname{inverse} which gives you the inverse map (\cref{fig:G2}).
