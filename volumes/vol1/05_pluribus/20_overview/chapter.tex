\chaptersecond{Putting things together}{chapter-lego}{chap:putting-things-together}{
	In this chapter we discuss the various types of ``compositions'' we find in applications.
	The basic idea is thinking about \emph{recipes} that produce something given a list of ingredients.
	We can ask many things about these recipes: does the order of ingredients matter?
	Can we go from results back to ingredients?
	Recipes can also be chained.
	And, we can think about meta-recipes that have other recipes as ingredients or results.
