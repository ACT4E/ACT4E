\chaptersecond{Putting things together}{chapter-lego}{}{
    In this chapter we discuss the various types of ``compositions'' we find in applications.
    The basic idea is thinking about \emph{recipes} that produce something given a list of ingredients. We can ask many things about these recipes: does the order of ingredients matter? Can we go from results back to ingredients?
    Recipes can also be chained. And, we can think about meta-recipes that have other recipes as ingredients or results.
