Set and functions are fundamental notions in mathematics. In this chapter we given an informal treatment of those notions which are important for the purposes of this book, while avoiding further-going aspects. The material in this section should be mostly familiar to anyone with some training in engineering, computer science, a natural science, mathematics, etc. We suggest nonetheless reading through: we set some conventions, and some contents may be new or may be rendered in a new perspective. The rigorous use of set theory and category theory do involve taking care of some technical details, notably in dealing with ``Russel's paradox'' and ``size issues''. For our purposes and most ``day to day'' work, one can safely ignore these details. We refer those interested in such technical details to \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1279}.
