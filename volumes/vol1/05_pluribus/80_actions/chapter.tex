\chaptersecond{Actions}{chapter-ski}{chap:actions}{
    We have talked about semigroups, monoids, and groups as mathematical structures
    in isolation.
    In this chapter we discuss the concept of \emph{action} of a semigroup on \emph{another set}.
    For example, we discuss how linear transformations are a semigroup that \emph{act} on vectors.
