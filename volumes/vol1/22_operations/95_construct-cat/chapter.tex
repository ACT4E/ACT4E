\chaptersecond{Constructing categories}{chapter-swissair}{ch:construct-cat}{
    In this chapter we discuss various ways of building new categories from old ones.
    Given categories $\CatC$ and $\CatD$, we saw in \cref{def:cartesian-product-category} and \cref{def:disjoint-union-category} how to build their cartesian product $\CatC \times \CatD$ and their direct sum $\CatC + \CatD$, respectively.
    In addition to these constructions, we will now see how to start with a category $\CatC$ and construct its \emph{opposite category} $\CatC\op$, as well as various other categories derived from $\CatC$ by thinking of kinds of diagrams in $\CatC$ as objects themselves.
