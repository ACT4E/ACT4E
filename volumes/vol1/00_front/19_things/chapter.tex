\chaptersecond{Putting things together}{chapter-lego}{chap:putting-things-together}{
    In this chapter we discuss the various types of ``compositions'' we find in applications.
    The basic idea is thinking about \emph{recipes} that produce something given a list of ingredients.
    We can ask many things about these recipes: does the order of ingredients matter?
    Can we go from results back to ingredients?
    Recipes can also be chai{}ned.
    And, we can think about meta-recipes that have other recipes as ingredients or results.
