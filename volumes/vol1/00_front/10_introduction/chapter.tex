\chaptersecond{The view from above}{chapter-top}{chap:introduction}{

    In this first chapter, we give some motivation to look at the material in this book.

    What we aim to do is to accompany you to the top of the Peak of Abstraction and show you \emph{the view from above}, from which you will be able to see that many things that look different have the same structure.
