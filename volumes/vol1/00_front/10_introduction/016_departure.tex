\section[Departures from tradition]{Departures from traditional exposition}

We made several choices to streamline the traditional exposition of category theory, to make it more understandable and relevant to the engineering field.

\paragraph{Notation and convention}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In general, we use diagrammatic notation $\mora \then \morb$ (pronounced ``$\mora$ then  $\morb$'') rather than $\morb \after \mora$ (pronounced ``$\morb$ after $\mora$'') for function composition.
    \item In the discussion of semigroups, we use ``$\then$'' rather than ``$\circ$'' as the semigroup composition operation.
          This is because for us a semigroup/monoid is a special (semi)category with only one object.
    \item In \cref{chap:actions} we discuss \emph{covariant} and \emph{contravariant} actions.
          We do not use the terms \emph{left} and \emph{right} actions because they are notation-dependent.
    \item We abundantly use \emph{semi}categories (semifunctors, \etc).
          For us semicategory is the primitive definition.
          A category is a semicategory with a particular property: having identities at each object.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Use of colors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We use colors to aid in the parsing of formulas and diagrams.
          However, color is not necessary to infer meaning.
          The choice of colors is colorblind-friendly.
          (One of the authors is colorblind.)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Materials covered}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Certain topics (limits, Yoneda's lemma, \etc) that would be traditionally discussed relatively soon, are not discussed in the first volumes.

    \item The text uses traditional set theory.
          To ground the exercises, we use slightly more formal type theory foundations (setoids, apartdness, \etc).

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Treatment of monoidal categories}

\todotext{@AC: alphubel: Write about the treatment of monoidal categories}

\paragraph{Induction vs deduction}

The greatest difference between this text and a mathematical text is the use of an inductive exposition rather than a deductive explanation.
In a typical mathematical exposition of category theory, one defines a general mathematical structure, and then give several specific examples.
\todotext{Cite the particular book}
Instead, here we first build up the examples as something that is interesting per se, and then we show how they can be all be instances of the same general concept.
In this way, the general concept is well motivated.
The path laid by the book is one of \emph{spiral learning}.

\todotext{Finish this part}

\devel{
    For example, we walk along the path of
    \begin{equation}
        \text{monoid morphisms}  \to \text{category actions} \to \text{functors}.
    \end{equation}

    Similarly, we  look at

    \begin{equation}
        \text{set product}  \to \text{poset product} \to \text{categorical product}.
    \end{equation}
