We thank Joshua Tan (University of Oxford) to help define some concepts of monotone co-design theory.

We thank all the students at ETH Zürich who followed the class for being guinea pigs and giving constructive feedback.

We thank all the students of the online courses we did on the material for giving us the enthusiasm and the energy to get this done.
