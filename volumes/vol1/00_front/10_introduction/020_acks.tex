\section{Acknowledgments}

There is a multitude of causes that made it possible for this book to come into creation.
Here is a short, incomplete list of the people that contributed to make this happen.

We thank David Spivak (Topos Institute) for starting the epidemic of applied category theory that infected us.

We thank Joshua Tan (University of Oxford) to help define some concepts of monotone co-design theory.

We thank all the students at ETH ZÃ¼rich who followed the class for being guinea pigs and giving constructive feedback.

We thank all the students of the online courses we did on the material for giving us the enthusiasm and the energy to get this done.
