\section{Code exercises}

\subsection{Prerequisites}

You will need the following skills:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Python programming.
If you want to learn Python, we suggest you look at
    \href{https://www.edx.org/learn/python}{EdX's courses}.
    \item Git / Github usage.
If you want to learn Git and Github, go to \href{https://try.github.io/}{try.github.io}.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, it might be useful to have some idea of what Docker is.
In theory you don't need to know anything about Docker, if everything goes well in our autograding scripts.

\subsection{Sign up on Github}

Sign up on Github if you haven't already.

\subsection{Option 1: Using Github Classroom}\label{subsec:with-classroom}

\begin{quote}
    \emph{
        If you are following a class where the instructors are using Github Classroom,
        this is the section for you.
Otherwise, jump to \cref{sub:without-classroom}.}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Get invite link and accept assignment}
Github Classroom is a product that helps coordinate assignments for large classes.

Your instructors will send you an invite link to join the classroom.
An invite link is similar to this:

\url{https://classroom.github.com/a/XXXXXXX}

If you are not enrolled in an official class, then you can get the invite link on Zulip.

In any case, do not pass invite links around: there are different ``classrooms''.
Do not use old links because the classroom is refreshed after each season.

\subsubsection{Clone the repository}

Once you go through the procedure, you will have created a repository

\begin{quote}
    \str{https://github.com/INSTRUCTORS/solution-YOU}
\end{quote}
where \str{INSTRUCTORS} is the Github organization for the instructors, and \str{YOU} is your username.

Clone the repository just created and jump into the directory.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includesag{dirtree-setup}
    \caption{Original content of the exercise template repository.}
    \label{fig:dirtree-setup}
\end{marginfigure}

You should see the content as in \cref{fig:dirtree-setup}.

In the following we list two options for you to be able to use the ACT4E interfaces when you code.

\subsubsection{Interfaces}

The next step is to make sure that you can use the ``interfaces repository''.
That repository contains all the Python snippets you see in this book.
Your IDE needs it so that it can help you write the correct code.

For this, we offer two options.
You can clone the ``interfaces'' repository (from within your repository):

\url{https://github.com/ACT4E/ACT4E-exercises.git}

and in there do

\begin{console}
    python setup.py develop
\end{console}

Alternatively, you can directly install the python package:

\begin{console}
    pip install ACT4E-exercises
\end{console}

In both cases, please pull (in case you clone the repository) or update (in case you install the package) weekly, to always use the most updated version.

\subsection{Option 2: Independent use without Github Classroom}
\label{sub:without-classroom}

\begin{quote}
    \emph{
        If you are \emph{not} following a class where the instructors are using Github Classroom,
        this is the section for you.
Otherwise, jump to \cref{subsec:with-classroom}.
    }
\end{quote}

In this section we assume that you are not part of a class.

In that case, you can fork directly the repository

\url{https://github.com/ACT4E/ACT4E-exercises-template}

Note that there might be different branches to choose from.
The instructions in this book correspond to the branch \texttt{spring2021}.

You can do the exercises on your own by using this repository.

In the following, ignore any other mention of Github Classroom.

\subsection{Docker installation}

Install Docker following the information at

\url{https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/}

Inside your repository, do

\begin{console}
    make pull
\end{console}

before starting your coding session.
This will make sure that you are using the most updated version of the infrastructure provided by us.
