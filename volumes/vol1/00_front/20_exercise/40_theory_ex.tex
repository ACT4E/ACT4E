\section{Turning in exercises}\label{sec:handin_instructions}

Via GitHub Classroom you can easily turn in your exercises.

Each graded exercise is characterized by a name (for instance \texttt{Test\-Finite\-Set\-Representation}).

To hand in an exercise, simply commit it with the name as the commit message, and push it to your solutions branch.

In the case of code exercises, the push will automatically result in an evaluation, which will assign you points (running the same tests as the ones you can run before pushing).
