\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Prerequisites}

You will need the following skills:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Python programming. If you want to learn Python, we suggest you look at
  \href{https://www.edx.org/learn/python}{EdX's courses}.
  \item Git / Github usage. If you want to learn Git and Github, go to \href{https://try.github.io/}{try.github.io}.
 \end{itemize}

Additionally, it might be useful to have some idea of what Docker is. In theory you don't need to know anything about Docker, if everything goes well in our autograding scripts.
