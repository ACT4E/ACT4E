\section{Latex environments}

\subsection{Non-graded exercises}

Use \str{exercise}/\str{solution} for exercises with the provided solution for all.

The exercise will appear inline, the solution will appear at the end of the Part.

For example, this code:

\begin{minted}{latex}
\begin{exercise}[Name]\label{ex:ex1}
  This is an exercise.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  This is a solution to \cref{ex:ex1}.
\end{solution}
\end{minted}

Make it appear here only the statement; you have to follow the link to read the solution.

\begin{exercise}[Name]
  \label{ex:ex1}
  This is an exercise.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  This is a solution to \cref{ex:ex1}.
\end{solution}

\subsection{Graded exercises}

Use the environment \str{gradedexercise} for an exercise that is graded.

Note: we don't rely on numbers for the graded exercises, but rather we give them code names.
The code name can then be used in the Python code, or to name the solution files for the exercises, etc.

\begin{minted}{latex}
\begin{gradedexercise}[\exname{MyCodeName}] \label{ex:MyCodeName}
  This is a graded exercise.
\end{gradedexercise}
\end{minted}


\begin{gradedexercise}[\exname{MyCodeName}]
  This is a graded exercise.
\end{gradedexercise}


Do not include the solution in this repo. It will need to go in the repo
\str{ACT4E-solutions}.

\todo{Include mechanism not defined as of now}
