\chaptersecond{Lattice structure}{chapter-krampus}{chap:locally-posetal}{
    In the previous chapter we have talked about the posetal structure of hom-sets.
    In \DP \SY{hom-sets} are also posets: morphisms can be ordered, and this order is preserved by composition.
    Moreover, it also has a \SY{lattice} structure that is preserved by composition.
