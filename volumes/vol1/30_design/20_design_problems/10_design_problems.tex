\section[DPIs]{Design Problems with Implementation}
\label{sec:Design-Problems}
\linkvideo{spring2021-design:design:dpi-def} % Design problems with implementation (DPIs)
We start by defining a ``design problem with implementation'', which is a tuple of ``\F{functionality} space'', ``\Icol{implementation} space'', and ``\R{resources} space'', together with two maps that describe the feasibility relations between these three spaces (\cref{fig:setup}).

\begin{definition}[Design problem with implementation]
    \label{def:DPI}
    A \maindef{design problem with implementation} (DPI) is a tuple
    \begin{equation}
        \tup{\funsp, \ressp, \impsp, \prov, \req},
    \end{equation}
    where:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \funsp is a poset, called \emph{\Fcol{functionality} space};
        \item \ressp is a poset, called \emph{\Rcol{requirements} space};
        \item \impsp is a set, called \emph{\Icol{implementation} space};
        \item the map~$\prov\colon\impsp\sto\funsp$
              maps an implementation to the functionality it provides;
        \item the map~$\req\colon\impsp\sto\ressp$
              maps an implementation to the resources it requires.
    \end{itemize}

\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Motor design]
    \label{exa:motor}
    Suppose we need to choose a motor for a robot from a given set.
    The \F{functionality} of a motor could be parametrized by \textF{torque} and \textF{speed}.
    The \R{resources} to consider could include the \R{\unit[cost]{[USD]}}, the \R{\unit[mass]{[g]}}, the input \R{\unit[voltage]{[V]}}, and the input \R{\unit[current]{[A]}}.
    The map~$\prov \colon \impsp\to\funsp$ assigns to each motor its functionality, and the map~$\req \colon \impsp\rightarrow\ressp$ assigns to each motor the resources it needs~(\cref{fig:motor_evalexec}).

\begin{example}[Chassis design]
    \label{exa:chassis}
    Suppose we need to choose a chassis for a robot.
    The implementation space~\impsp~(\cref{fig:gmcdp_chassis_eval}) could be the set of all chassis that could ever be designed (in case of a theoretical analysis), or just the set of chassis available in the catalogue at hand (in case of a practical design decision).
    The functionality of a chassis could be formalized as ``the ability to transport a certain \F{payload
    {[}g{]}}'' and ``at a given \F{speed {[}m/s{]}}''.
    More refined functional requirements would include maneuverability, the cargo volume, \etc
    The resources to consider could be the \R{cost {[}USD{]}} of the chassis; the total mass;
    and, for each motor to be placed in the chassis, the required \R{speed {[}rad/s{]}} and \R{torque {[}Nm{]}}.

    We revisit the leading example of \cref{sec:attributes_sameness} with the newly introduced co-design perspective.

        \caption{A simplified catalogue of motors.
        }
        \label{tab:electric_motors_2}
    \end{table*}

    We can think of this as a catalogue of electric motors~$\tup{\impsp_\mathrm{EM},\prov_\mathrm{EM},\req_\mathrm{EM}}$.
    In particular, the set of implementations collects all the motor models, which we can specify using the motor IDs:
    \begin{equation}
        \impsp_\mathrm{EM}=\makeset{1204,1206,1207,2267,2279,1478,2299 }.
    \end{equation}
    We now have to think about \textR{resources} and \textF{functionalities}.
    Each motor \textR{requires} some \textR{weight} (in \unit[]{g}), \textR{power} (in \unit[]{W}), and has some \textR{cost} (in USD), and \textF{provides} some \textF{torque} (in~$\unit[]{kg\cdot cm}$).
    Thus, we can identify
    \begin{equation}
        \funsp =\reals^{\unit[]{kg\cdot cm}},\quad \ressp=\reals^{\unit[]{g}}\cartprod \reals^{\unit[]{W}}\cartprod \reals^{\unit[]{USD}},
    \end{equation}
    by considering the units as discussed in \cref{sec:currency_cat}.
    The correspondences are given by the details in \cref{tab:electric_motors_2}.
    For instance, we have
    \begin{align}
        \prov_\mathrm{EM}(1204)=\unit[0.18]{kg\cdot cm}, \\ \req_\mathrm{EM}(1204)=\tup{\unit[60]{g},\unit[2.34]{W},\unit[19.95]{USD}}.

\subsubsection{Graphical notation}

A graphical notation will help reasoning about composition.
A DPI is represented as a box with~$\dpinumf$ green edges and~$\dpinumr$ red edges~(\cref{fig:dp_graphical}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{520_general_dp}
    \caption{\label{fig:dp_graphical}}
\end{figure}

%\captionsideleft{\label{fig:dp_graphical}}{\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{gmcdp_dp_graphical.pdf}}

This means that the functionality and resources spaces can be factorized in~$\dpinumf$ and~$\dpinumr$ components:
\begin{equation}
    \funsp=\prod_{i=1}^{\dpinumf}\pi_{i}\funsp_{i},\quad \ressp=\prod_{j=1}^{\dpinumr}\pi_{j}\ressp_{j},
\end{equation}
where ``$\pi_{i}$'' represents the projection to the~$i$-th component.
If there are no \textF{green} (respectively, \textR{red}) edges, then~$\dpinumf$ (respectively,~$\dpinumr$) is zero, and \funsp (respectively, \ressp) is equal to~$\One=\makeset{\emptytuple }$, the set containing one element, the empty tuple~$\emptytuple$.

These \emph{co-design diagrams} are not to be confused with signal flow diagrams, in which the boxes represent oriented systems and the edges represent signals.

\todotextjira{297}{\alphubel: @Andrea: We start right away talking about monotonicity after the DPI definition, but the link is not clear.}

\section{Examples}
We now present a list of \SY{design problems} for different disciplines, to showcase the universality of the approach.

\subsubsection{Mechatronics}
Many mechanisms can be readily modeled as relations between a provided functionality and required resources.

%\begin{example}
%    The \textF{functionality} of a DC motor~(\cref{fig:dc_motor}) is to provide a certain \textF{speed} and \textF{torque}, and the \textR{resources} are \textR{current} and \textR{voltage}.
%\end{example}
%\todotextjira{296}{@Andrea: Add equation that relate all.}
%\todotextjira{296}{@Andrea: What are the implementations?}

%\begin{figure}[h!]
%    \centering
%    \includesag{520_dc_motor}
%    \caption{}
%    \label{fig:dc_motor}
%\end{figure}

\begin{example}
    A gearbox (\cref{fig:gearbox}) provides a certain \textF{output torque} $\F{\tau_o}$ and \textF{speed} $\F{\omega_o}$, given a certain \R{input torque $\tau_i$} and \R{speed $\omega_i$}.
    For an ideal gearbox with a reduction ratio ${\colI r} \setin \ratnumbers_+$ and efficiency ratio $\colI\gamma$, $0<\gamma<1$, the constraints among those quantities are ${\colR \omega_i}\geq r\,{\colF \omega_o}$ and ${\colR \tau_i\omega_i}\geq\gamma\,{\colF \tau_o\omega_o}$.
    With this simple model, the set of implementations are given by the possible values of reduction and efficiency ratio.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{520_dp_gearbox}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:gearbox}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
    \emph{Propellers}~(\cref{fig:propeller}) generate \F{thrust} given a certain \R{torque} and \R{speed}.
    % A simple model is that thrust is proportional to the product of the torque and the speed.
\end{example}
\todotextjira{742}{\alphubel: @Gioele: Can you write down a model for propeller thrust? Double check that it is monotone.}
\todotextjira{296}{\alphubel: @Andrea: What are the implementations?}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{520_dp_propellers}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:propeller}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
    A four-bar \emph{crank-rocker} (\cref{fig:crack}) converts \R{rotational motion} into a \F{rocking motion}.
    The parametrization depends on the length of the four linkages.
\end{example}
\todographicsjira{743}{\alphubel: @Gioele: Put here an additional crank-rocker mechanism figure so that people who don't know that can get an idea.}
\todotextjira{743}{\alphubel: @Gioele:
    Also can we find some equations describing relation between torque, speed and force.
}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{520_crank}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:crack}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Geometrical constraints}

Geometrical constraints are examples of constraints that are easily recognized as monotone, but possibly hard to write down in closed form.

\begin{example}[Bin packing]
    Suppose that each internal component occupies a volume bounded by a parallelepiped, and that we must choose the minimal enclosure in which to place all components~(\cref{fig:packing}).
    What is the minimal size of the enclosure?
    This is a variation of the \emph{bin packing} problem, which is in NP for both 2D and 3D~\cite{lodi02two}.
    It is easy to see that the problem is monotone, by noticing that, if one the components shapes increases, then the size of the enclosure cannot shrink.
    The implementations, in this case, are the configurations which one can choose to place all components in the container (one of the possible configurations is shown in the picture).
\end{example}
\begin{figure}[tbh]
    \centering
    \includesag{bin_packing}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:packing}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Inference}

Many inference problems have a monotone formalization, taking the
\F{accuracy} or \F{robustness} as functionality, and \R{computation}
or \R{sensing} as resources.
Typically, these bounds are known in a closed form only for restricted classes of systems, such as the linear/Gaussian setting.

\begin{example}[SLAM]
    One issue with particle-filter-based estimation procedures, such as the ones used in the popular GMapping~\cite{grisetti07improved} suite, is that the filter might diverge if there aren't enough particles.
    Although the relation might be hard to characterize, there is a monotone relation between the \F{robustness} (1 - probability of failure), the \F{accuracy}, and the \R{number of particles}~(\cref{fig:gmapping}).
    Here, the implementation space contains the other choices of parameters for the filter: fixed the number of particles, by changing the tuning of the filter, we can explore the trade-off of accuracy and robustness.
\end{example}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{520_mapping}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:gmapping}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}[Stereo reconstruction]
    Progressive reconstruction systems (\cite{locher16progressive}), which start with a coarse approximation of the solution that is progressively refined, are described by a smooth relation between the \F{resolution} and the \R{latency} to obtain the answer~(\cref{fig:progressive}).
    A similar relation characterizes any anytime algorithms in other domains, such as robot motion planning.
\end{example}

\todotextjira{296}{\alphubel: @Andrea: What are the implementations?}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{520_stereo}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:progressive}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
    The empirical characterization of the monotone relation between \F{the accuracy of a visual SLAM solution} and \R{the power consumption} is the goal of recent work by Davison and colleagues~\cite{nardi15introducing,zia16comparative}.
\end{example}

\todographicsjira{153}{Reproduce plot from paper.}

\subsubsection{Communication}

\begin{example}[Transducers]
    Any type of ``transducer'' that bridges between different mediums can be modeled as a DP.
    For example, an access point~(\cref{fig:accesspoint}) provides the \F{wireless access} functionality, and requires that the infrastructure provides the \R{Ethernet access} resource.
\end{example}

\todotextjira{296}{\alphubel: @Andrea: What are the implementations?}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{520_ethernet}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:accesspoint}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}[Wireless link]
    The basic functionality of a wireless link is to provide a certain \F{bandwidth} (\cref{fig:networklink}).
    Further refinements could include bounds on the latency or the probability that a packet drop is dropped.
    Given the established convention about the preference relations for functionality, in which a \emph{lower} functionality is ``easier''
    to achieve, one needs to choose ``\F{\emph{minus} the latency}'' and ``\F{\emph{minus} the packet drop probability}'' for them to count as functionality.
    As for the resources, apart from the \R{transmission power [W]}, one should consider at least \R{the spectrum occupation}, which could be described as an interval~$[f_0,f_1]$ of the frequency axis $\reals^{\unit[]{[Hz]}}$.
    Thus, the resources space is $\ressp=\colR\reals^{\unit[]{[W]}}\cartprod\aword{intervals}(\reals^{\unit[]{[Hz]}})$.
\end{example}

    \label{fig:networklink}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Multi-robot systems}

In a multi-robot system there is always a trade-off between the number of robots and the capabilities of the single robot.
\begin{example}
    Suppose we need to create a swarm of agents whose functionality is
    \F{to sweep an area}.
    If the functionality is fixed, one expects a three-way trade-off between the three resources: number of agents, the speed of a single agent, and the execution time.
    For example, if the time available decreases, we have to increase either the speed of an agent or the number of agents~(\cref{fig:multirobot2}).
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Computation graphs}

The trivial model of a CPU is as a device that provides \Fcol{computation, measured in flops}, and requires \Rcol{power [W]}.
Clearly there is a monotone relation between the two.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{520_dp_cpu}
    \caption{}
\end{figure}

A similar monotone relation between application requirements and computation resources holds in a much more general setting, where both application and computation resources are represented by graphs.
This will be an example of a monotone relation between nontrivial partial orders.

In the Static Data Flow (SDF) model of computation~\cite[Chapter 3]{sriram00,lee10}, the application is represented as a graph of procedures that need to be allocated on a network of processors.

\begin{figure*}[h!]
    \centering
    \subfloat[]{
        \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{reits2_small_app_graph}

    }
    \caption{}
\end{figure*}

Define the\emph{ application graph }(sometimes called ``computation graph'') as a graph where each node is a procedure (or ``actor'') and each edge is a message that needs to be passed between procedures.
Each node is labeled by the number of ops necessary to run the procedure.
Each edge is labeled by the size of the message.
There is a partial order~$\ordleq$ on application graphs.
In this order, it holds that~$A_1 \ordleq A_2$ if the application graph~$A_2$ needs more computation or bandwidth for its execution than~$A_1$.
Formally, it holds that~$A_1 \ordleq A_2$
if there is a homomorphism~$\varphi \colon A_1 \Rightarrow A_2$; and, for each node~$n \setin A_1$, the node~$\varphi(n)$ has equal or larger computational requirements than~$n$; and for each edge~$\tup{n_1,n_2}$
in~$~A_2$, the edge~$\tup{\varphi (n_1), \varphi (n_2)}$ has equal or larger message size.

Define a \emph{resource graph} as a graph where each node represents a processor, and each edge represents a network link.
Each node is labeled by the processor capacity [flops] Each edge is labeled by latency [s] and bandwidth [B/s].
There is a partial order on resources graph as well: it holds that~$R_1 \ordleq R_2$ if the resource graph~$R_2$ has more computation or network available than~$R_1$.
The definition is similar to the case of the application graph: there must exist a \SY{graph homomorphism}~$\varphi \colon R_1 \Rightarrow R_2$
and the corresponding nodes (edges) of~$R_2$ must have larger or equal computation (bandwidth) than those of~$R_1$.

Given an application graph~$A$ and a resource graph~$R$, a typical resource allocation problem consists in choosing in which processor each actor must be scheduled to maximize the throughput~$T$~[Hz].
This is equivalent to the problem of finding a \SY{graph homomorphism}~$\Psi \colon A \Rightarrow R$.
Let~$T^{\ast}$ be the optimal throughput, and write it as a function of the two graphs:
\begin{equation}
    T^{\ast}=T^{\ast}(A,R).
\end{equation}
Then the optimal throughput~$T^{\ast}$ is decreasing in~$A$ (a more computationally demanding application graph decreases the throughput) and increasing in~$R$ (more available computation/bandwidth increase the throughput).

Therefore, we can formalize this as a \SY{design problem} where the two functionalities are \F{the throughput~$T$ [Hz]} and \F{the application graph~$A$}, and the \R{resource graph~$R$} is the resource.

\begin{example}
    Svorenova\,\,\etal~\cite{svorenova16resource} consider a joint sensor scheduling and control synthesis problem, in which a robot can decide to not perform sensing to save power, given performance objectives on the probability of reaching the target and the probability of collision.
    The method outputs a Pareto frontier of all possible operating points.
    This can be cast as a \SY{design problem} with functionality equal to the \F{probability of reaching the target} and (the inverse of) \F{the collision probability}, and with resources equal to the
    \R{actuation power}, \R{sensing power}, and \R{sensor accuracy}.
\end{example}

    Nardi\,\,\etal~\cite{zia16comparative} describe a benchmarking system for visual SLAM that provides the empirical characterization of the monotone relation between \F{the accuracy} of the visual SLAM solution, the \F{throughput {[}frames/s{]}} and \R{the energy for computation {[}J/frame{]}}.
    The implementation space is the product of algorithmic parameters, compiler flags, and architecture choices, such as the number of GPU cores active.
    This is an example of a \SY{design problem} whose functionality-resources map needs to be experimentally evaluated.

\subsubsection{Other examples in minimal robotics}

Many works have sought to find ``minimal'' designs for robots, and can be understood as characterizing the relation between the \SY{poset} of \F{tasks} and the \SY{poset} of physical resources, which is the product of \R{sensing}, \R{actuation}, and \R{computation} resources, plus other non-physical resources, such as \R{prior knowledge}~(\cref{fig:robot-generic}).
Given a task, there is a minimal \SY{antichain} in the resources \SY{poset} that describes the possible trade-offs (for instance, compensating lousier sensors with more computation).

The \SY{poset} structure arises naturally: for example, in the \emph{sensor lattice}~\cite{lavalle12sensing}, a sensor dominates another if it induces a finer \SY{partition} of the state space.
Similar dominance relations can be defined for actuation and computation.
O'Kane and Lavalle~\cite{okane08comparing} define a robot as a union of ``robotic primitives'', where each primitive is an abstraction for a set of sensors, actuators, and control strategies that can be used together
(for instance, a compass plus a contact sensor allow to ``drive North until a wall is hit'').
The effect of each primitive is modeled as an operator on the robot's information space.
It is possible to work out what are the minimal combinations of robotic primitives (minimal \SY{antichain}) that are sufficient to perform a task (for instance, global localization), and describe a dominance relation (partial order) of primitives.
Other works have focused on minimizing the complexity of the controller.
Egerstedt~\cite{egerstedt03motion} studies the relation between the \F{complexity of the environment} and a notion of \R{minimum description length of control strategies}, which can be taken as a proxy for the computation necessary to perform the task.
Soatto~\cite{soatto11steps} studies the relation between the \F{performance of a visual task}, and the \R{minimal representation} that is needed to perform that task.
