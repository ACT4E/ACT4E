    We have seen that categories have a built-in notion of horizontal composition.
    We have seen that some categories have also a notion of parallelism using ``vertical stacking''.
    Some categories have also a ``feedback structure'', which can be used to ``close the loop'' in diagrams.
    In control systems, this is called ``feedback'' because some signals are fed back into the system.
    In other categories, such as \DP, this feedback can be used to model recursive constraints.
