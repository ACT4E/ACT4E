\section{The category of design problems $\DP$}

Finally, we can declare that the design problems so defined are morphisms in a category that we call~\iindex{\DP}.

% We will show that the class of all design problems forms a category, which we call~\iindex{\DP}.

\begin{definition}[Category of design problems]
    \label{def:DP}
    The \emph{\iindex{category of design problems},~\DP}, consists of the following constituents:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item \emph{Objects}: The objects of~\DP are posets.
        \item \emph{Morphisms}: The morphisms of~\DP are design problems (\cref{def:design-problem}).
        \item \emph{Identity morphism}: The identity morphism~$\catid_\posgenA \colon \funposA \profto \resposA$ is given by \cref{def:dp-identity}.
        \item \emph{Composition operation}: Given morphisms~$\adpa \colon  \funposA \profto \resposB$ and~$\adpb \colon \funposB \profto \resposC$, their composition~$\adpa \mthen \adpb\colon \funposA\profto \resposC$ is given by \cref{def:dp-series}.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{definition}

We have already shown that the composition operator ``$\mthen$'' is associative and unital, and that the composition of two design problems is a design problem (closure).
Therefore, \DP is a category.

\begin{remark}
    \DP is called \feas or~$\Cat{Prof}_\Bool$ in~\cite{fong2019}.
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}
    We will see in \cref{sec:DPI-semicat} that the DPIs (design problems with implementations) also have a categorical interpretation as a semi-category \DPI and that there is a functor from~$\DPI$ to~$\DP$.
\end{remark}
