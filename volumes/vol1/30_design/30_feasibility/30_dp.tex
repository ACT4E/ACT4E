\section{The category of design problems \DP}

\todotextjira{280}{@Andrea: Discuss functor from \DPI to \DP}

Finally, we can declare that the design problems so defined are morphisms in a category that we call~\DP.

% We will show that the class of all design problems forms a category, which we call~\iindex{\DP}.

\begin{definition}[Category of design problems \DP]\index{\DP|textbf}
    \label{def:DP}
    The \emph{\iindex{category of design problems} \DP} consists of the following constituents:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Objects}: The objects of~\DP are posets.
        \item \emph{Morphisms}: The morphisms of~\DP are design problems (\cref{def:design-problem}).
        \item \emph{Identity morphism}: The identity morphism~$\stylefunctors{\id}_\posgenA \colon \funposA \profto \resposA$ is given by \cref{def:dp-identity}.
        \item \emph{Composition operation}: Given morphisms~$\adpa \colon  \funposA \profto \resposB$ and~$\adpb \colon \funposB \profto \resposC$, their composition~$\adpa \mthen \adpb\colon \funposA\profto \resposC$ is given by \cref{def:dp-series}.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

We have already shown that the composition operator ``$\mthen$'' is associative and unital, and that the composition of two design problems is a design problem (closure).
Therefore, \DP is a category.

\begin{remark}
    \DP is called \feas or~$\Cat{Prof}_\Bool$ in~\cite{fong2019}.
\end{remark}

%     \begin{remark}
%         We will see in \cref{sec:DPI-semicat} that the DPIs (design problems with implementations) also have a categorical interpretation as a semicategory \DPI and that there is a functor from~\DPI to~\DP.
%     \end{remark}

    \subsection{Relation between \DPI and \DP}

    We have already seen in \cref{rem:DP-from-DPI} that we can obtain a DP from a DPI.
    We can make this more formal and say that there exists a \emph{forgetful semifunctor} from \DPI to \DP.

    \todotext{@Gioele: Define this semifunctor}

    In the other direction, we can take a DP and find a corresponding DPI.
    We obtain another semifunctor.
