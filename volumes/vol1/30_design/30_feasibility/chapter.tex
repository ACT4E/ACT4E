\chaptersecond{Feasibility}{chapter-steinstossen}{chap:feasibility}{

    In the previous chapter we have introduced the \emph{design problems with implementations}.
    Those describe relations among 3 sets: functionality, resources, and implementations.

    If we are not interested in the implementations, we can simplify the model and obtain a relation directly between functionality and resources.
    We obtain in this way a category \DP.
