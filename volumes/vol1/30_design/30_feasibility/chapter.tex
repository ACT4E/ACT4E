    In the previous chapter we have introduced the semi-category \DPI of design problems with implementations. Those describes relations among 3 sets: functionality, resources, and implementations.

    If we are not interested in the implementations, we can simplify the model and obtain a relation directly betweef functionality and resources. We obtain in this way a category \DP.
