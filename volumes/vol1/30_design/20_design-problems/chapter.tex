\chaptersecond{Monotone Design Problems}{chapter-swissarmyknife}{}{
    This chapter introduces \emph{design problems with implementations}, which summarize a design problem
    as a relation among functionality, resources, and implementations.

    We show that they form a semi-category \DPI.

    We provide several examples from diverse fields.
