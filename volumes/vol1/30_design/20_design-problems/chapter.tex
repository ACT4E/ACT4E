\chaptersecond{Monotone Design Theory}{chapter-swissarmyknife}{}{


    This chapter introduces  \emph{Monotone Design Theory}, a formalization for computational design theory.
    It is a compositional theory of which the primitive elements are \emph{design problems} (DPI),
    formalized as a relations among functionality, resources, and implementations.

    We show that DPIs can capture design problems across diverse fields.
