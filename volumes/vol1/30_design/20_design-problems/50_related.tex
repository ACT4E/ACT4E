\section{Discussion of related work}
\label{sec:design-problems-related}

\subsection{Theory of design}

Modern engineering has long since recognized the two ideas of modularity
and hierarchical decomposition, yet there exists no general quantitative
theory of design that is applicable to different domains. Most of
the works in the theory of design literature study abstractions that
are meant to be useful for a human designer, rather than an automated
system. For example, a \emph{function structure} diagram~\cite[p. 32]{pahl07}
decomposes the function of a system in subsystems that exchange energy,
materials, and signals, but it is not a formal representation. From
the point of view of the theory of design, the contribution of this
work is that the \emph{design problem }abstraction developed, where
one takes functionality and resources as the interfaces for the subsystems,
is at the same time (1) mathematically precise; (2)~intuitive to
understand; and (3)~leads to tractable optimization problems.

This work also provides a clear answer to one long-standing issue
in the theory of design: the inter-dependence between subsystems,
(in other words, cycles in the co-design graph). Consider, as an example, Suh's
theory of \emph{axiomatic design~}\cite{suh01}, in which the first
``axiom'' is to keep the design requirements orthogonal (in other words, do
not introduce cycles). This work shows that it is possible to deal
elegantly with recursive constraints.

\subsection{Partial Order Programming}

In ``Partial Order Programming''~\cite{parkerjr89partial} Parker
studies a hierarchy of optimization problems that can be represented
as a set of partial order constraints. The main interest is to study
partial order constraints as the means to define the semantics of
programming languages and for declarative approaches to knowledge
representation.

In Parker's hierarchy, MCDPs are most related to the class of problems
called \emph{continuous monotone partial order program} (CMPOP). CMPOPs
are the least specific class of problems studied by Parker for which
it is possible to obtain existence results and a systematic solution
procedure. MCDPs subsume CMPOPs. A CMPOP is an MCDP where: 1)~All
functionality and resources belong to the same poset~$\posA$ ($\funsp_{v}=\ressp_{v}=\posA$);
2)~Each functionality/resource relation is a simple map, rather than
a multi-valued relation; 3)~There are no dangling functionality edges
in the co-design diagram ($\funsp=\One$).

In a MCDP, each DP is described by a \scottcontinuous map~$\ftor:\funsp\rightarrow\Aressp$
which maps one functionality to a minimal set of resources. By contrast,
in a CMPOP an operator corresponds to a \scottcontinuous map~$\ftor:\funsp\rightarrow\ressp$.
The consequence is that a CMPOP has a unique solution~\cite[Theorem 8]{parkerjr89partial},
while an MCDP can have multiple minimal solutions (or none at all).

\subsection{Abstract interpretation}

The methods used from order theory are the same used in the field
of \emph{abstract interpretation}~\cite{cousot14abstract}. In
that field, the least fixed point semantics arises from problems such
as computing the sets of reachable states. Given a starting state,
one is interested to find a subset of states that is closed under
the dynamics (in other words, a fixed point), and that is the smallest that contains
the given initial state (in other words, a \emph{least} fixed point). Reachability
and other properties lead to considering systems of equation of the
form
\begin{align}
    x_{i} & =\varphi_{i}(x_{1},\,\dots\,,x_{i},\,\dots\,,x_{n}),\quad i=1,\dots,n,\label{eq:ai}
\end{align}
where each value of the index $i$ is for a control point of the program,
and~$\varphi_{i}$ are \scottcontinuous functions on the abstract
lattice that represents the properties of the program. In the simplest
case, each~$x_{i}$ could represent intervals that a variable could
assume at step~$i$. By applying the iterations, one finds which
properties can be inferred to be valid at each step.

We can repeat the same considerations we did for Parker's CMPOPs vs
MCDPs. In particular, in MCDP we deal with multi-valued maps, and
there is more than one solution.

In the field of abstract interpretation much work has been done towards
optimizing the rate of convergence. The order of evaluation in~\cref{eq:ai}
does not matter. Asynchronous and ``chaotic'' iterations were proposed
early~\cite{cousot77asynchronous} and are still object of investigation~\cite{bourdoncleefficient}.
To speed up convergence, the so called ``widening'' and ``narrowing''
operators are used~\cite{cortesi11widening}. The ideas of chaotic
iteration, widening, narrowing, are not immediately applicable to
MCDPs, but it is a promising research direction.
