\begin{hint}
	You can switch order of the elements passed to the \funcname{holds} mapping.

	To switch the order of the elements, assume that the \funcname{source} of the mapping is a \classname{ProductSet} which has the \funcname{pack} and \funcname{unpack} functions.
	First unpack, switch, and then re-pack.
