    Check if a subset is a chain or an antichain.
    Implement the interface in \cref{lst:FinitePosetSubsetProperties}.

\begin{hint}
    To check if a subset is an antichain, it is sufficient to check if any pair of different elements are comparable.
    This requires $n(n-1)$ comparisons, and you cannot do better in general, without any additional assumption you can make on the poset.
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}
    To prove that a subset is a chain, you must produce an order for the elements.
    If you cannot find a consistent order, then the subset is not a chain.
    Therefore, an efficient way to do this might look like a sorting algorithm.
