    Check if a subset is a \SY{chain} or an \SY{antichain}.
}
\classlisting{FinitePosetSubsetProperties}

\begin{hint}
    To check if a subset is an \SY{antichain}, it is sufficient to check that no pair of different elements are comparable.
    This requires $n(n-1)$ comparisons, and you cannot do better in general, without any additional assumption on the poset.
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}
    To prove that a subset is a \SY{chain}, you must check that all elements are comparable.
    It is not necessary to produce an order.
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
    On the other hand, it might be more efficient to try to find the \SY{chain} order; it could save a lot of computation.
    An efficient way to do this is using a sorting algorithm (which can possibly fail, if some elements are not comparable.)
\end{hint}
