\classlisting{FinitePosetMeasurement}

\begin{hint}
    For computing the height of a finite (small) poset, it is easiest to just enumerate the chains and check which one is the longest.
    You can enumerate the chains by looking at the paths from the minimal to the maximal elements.
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}
    Computing the \emph{width} of a poset is more complicated.

    Note that enumerating all subsets and check which one is an antichain and record the largest we have complexity~$2^n$, so it is impracticable even for small sets.

    We mention here two results that can help.

    Dilwort's theorem shows that the \emph{width} of a poset (size of maximum \emph{antichain}) relates to a partition in \emph{chains}, while Mirksy's theorem shows that the \emph{height} of a poset (size of the longest \emph{chain}) relates to a partition in \emph{antichains}.

    \begin{theorem}[Dilwort's theorem]
        \label{thm:dilwort}
        A finite poset of width $w$ can be partitioned into $w$ chains.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{theorem}[Mirsky's theorem]
        \label{thm:mirsky}
        A finite poset of height $h$ can be partitioned into $w$ antichains.
    \end{theorem}

    Given Dilwort's theorem, one approach that works for small posets is to enumerate the chains and then find the smallest subset that covers the poset.

    There are many results published that give faster algorithms; see, \eg~\cite{chen12decomposition}.
