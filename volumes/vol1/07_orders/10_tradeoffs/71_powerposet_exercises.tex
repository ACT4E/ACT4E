    Write code to compute the power poset of a finite set.
}

\classlisting{PosetConstructionPower}

A \classname{PosetOfFiniteSubsets} is a poset whose carrier is a \classname{SetOfFiniteSubsets}.
We have already encountered this class in the exercise \cref{sec:power-set-exercise} (\cref{lst:SetOfFiniteSubsets}), which asked to create a power set. 

In this exercise you should reuse the code to create the carrier set. What is new is that you must write the code that defines the order on the subsets, which should be given by set inclusion. 

You have already written the code for checking for subset inclusion in the exercise \cref{sec:FiniteSetProperties}.
