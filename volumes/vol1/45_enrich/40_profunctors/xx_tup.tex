\begin{definition}[\Cat{Tup}]
    \label{def:Tup}
    There exists a category \Tup that consists of the following constituents:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item \emph{Objects}: The objects of~\Tup are lists of sets.
        \item \emph{Morphisms}: The morphisms of~\Tup are maps between tuples.
        A morphism from $[a_1, \dots, a_p]$ to $[b_1,\dots, b_q]$ is a $q$-tuple of morphisms $[f_1, \dots, f_q]$ where $f_i: a_1 \times \cdots \times a_n \to b_i$.
        \item \emph{Identity morphism}: The identity morphism are the products in sets.
        \item \emph{Composition operation}: Composition is given by function composition in the obvious way.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{definition}
This is monoidal, etc.

\begin{ctdefinition}[T-Profunctors]
    \label{def:Tprofunctor}
    Given two categories \CatC and \CatD, a \emph{\iindex{T-profunctor}} from \CatC to \CatD is a functor of the form
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:Tprofunctors-def-1}
        \funa\colon \CatC\op \Ctimes \CatD \fto_{\Category} \Tup.
    \end{equation}
\end{ctdefinition}
