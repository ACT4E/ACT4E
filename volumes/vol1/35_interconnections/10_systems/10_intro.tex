\section{Introduction to systems}

\todotext{Maybe include several examples throughout this intro to liven up the text and make it more concrete and engineering flavored}

The term ``system'' is not a precise mathematical term for us, but rather an intuitive concept that relates directly to modeling in engineering.
We will think of a system as having input and output ports with which it can interact with other systems (or its broader environment), and that a system in some way establishes a relationship between input and output signals.
This relationship might be a deterministic, causal relationship -- inputs determining outputs -- or it might be another form of lawfulness.

A typical way to depict a system diagrammatically is to draw it as a box, with externally extended wires indicating the input and output ports.
We will usually orient such diagrams horizontally, and assume that the left-hand wires indicate input ports, and right-hand wires indicate output ports.

\subsection{Composing systems}

Our concept of system is compositional: systems can be connected together to build larger, composite systems.
In the next chapter we will compose systems not only in series but also in parallel, and later we will also model feedback.

An illustrative example of systems are Moore machines, which we discussed in some length in \cref{chap:processes}.
Given a Moore machine
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:moore-machine-specification}
    \tup{\prinL,\prstL,\proutL,\prdyn,\prreadout,\prstart}
\end{equation}
with an input set $\prinL$ and an output $\proutL$.
When the output set of one machine matches the input set of another, we have already seen how to compose Moore machines in series such that the result is again a Moore machine.
We will soon also formalize parallel composition and feedback for Moore machines.

\subsection{System specification vs. system behavior}

We will make a distinction between ways of specifying a system, and ways of describing how a system might behave.

To see what we mean, consider the example of Moore machines.
A way to specify a Moore machine, according to our \cref{def:moore_machine_3rd}, is to specify a tuple of the form \cref{eq:moore-machine-specification}.

On the other hand, we saw that Moore machines can act on sequences or lists of signals in various ways.
We think of these actions as encoding ``behaviors'' that a Moore machine can exhibit.
The idea is that an action encodes a way that a Moore machine ``does something'' -- how it relates input signals to output signals.

Strictly speaking, we will think of just the specific relation between inputs and outputs as a behavior, and an action is a way of associating specified machines to specified behaviors.

\todotext{insert diagram illustrating the situation}

For example, given a machine
\begin{equation}
    \mora \colon \prinL \to \proutL
\end{equation}
specified by $\cref{eq:moore-machine-specification}$, the standard action \cref{def:moore-standard-action-on-sequences} associates to it a behavior
\begin{equation}
    \act(\mora) \colon \streamsof{\prinL} \to \streamsof{\proutL}.
\end{equation}
We can study specifications of machines and possible behaviors of machines each in their own right, and we can study ways that specifications and behaviors can be connected.

In \cref{sec:different-actions-of-moore-machines} we saw that different kinds of behaviors are possible, via different actions.
For example, not only behaviors of the type
\begin{equation}
    \streamsof{\prinL}  \to \streamsof{\proutL}
\end{equation}
but also of the type
\begin{equation}
    \listsof{\prinL} \to \listsof{\proutL}
\end{equation}
are possible.

In \cref{sec:LTI-systems} below on LTI systems, we will see an example of how a single system might be specified in different ways.
