\section{Introduction to systems}
\todojira{624}{fill the whole part}

\todotext{Maybe include several examples throughout this intro to liven up the text and make it more concrete and engineering flavored}

The term ``system'' is not a precise mathematical term for us, but rather an intuitive concept that relates directly to modeling in engineering. We will think of systems as having input and output ports with which it can interact with other systems (or its broader environment), and that a system in some way establishes a relationship between input and output signals. This relationship might be a deterministic, causal relationship -- inputs determining outputs -- or it might be another form of lawfulness.

\subsection{External and internal points of view}

Sometimes we will think of systems as if they are ``black boxes": that is, as if we don't know anything about their inner workings, and all we care about is their external behavior in terms of which inputs are related to which outputs. Other times we will focus on the inner workings of systems and different ways to model these mathematically.

\subsection{Composing systems}

No matter whether we are looking `inside' of systems or are just considering their external behavior, a key feature of our understanding of the term system is that systems make be composed together. First of all, for serial composition, this means that the output of one system is taken as the input for the next systems. Furthermore, we will also formalize notions of parallel composition of systems, and of feedback.


\section{Specifying systems}



Let's consider some different examples of systems and ways of specifying them.

\subsection{Moore machines}

Recall from \cref{sec:moore-machines} that a Moore machine with input set $\prin$ and output set $\prout$ is given by additionally specifying a state space set $\prst$ and two functions
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        \prdyn \colon \prin \cartprod \prst \sto \prst, \\
        \prreadout \colon \prst \sto \prout.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Linear time-invariant dynamical systems}


Typical a linear time-invariant dynamical system is typically specified by an input vector space $\prin$ and output set $\prout$

\section{System behaviors}

\todotext{Talk here briefly about the distinction between formal specifications or parametrizations of systems versus behaviors of systems; perhaps use Moore machines as an example}


\subsection{Modeling behavior}

Let $\Time = \tup{\Time, \leq}$ be a totally ordered set (a model of time).
Given a set $\Obja$, we will think here of the set $\Obja^\Time$ of functions $\Time \to \Obja$ as the set of time-dependent signals taking values in the signal space $\Obja$.

When want to talk about discrete-time signals, natural choices for $\Time$ might be $\Time = \natnumbers$ or $\Time = \wnumbers$.
When we want to talk about continuous time systems, we might choose $\Time = \reals$.
And when we want to talk about event-based systems, we can choose $\Time$ to consist of a set of possible events, ordered by their sequence of occurence.

The externally observable behavior of an input-output system is nothing else than a relation between input signals and output signals.

\begin{definition}
    Let $\Obja$ and $\Objb$ be sets.
    An \emph{input-output behavior}, with input signal space $\Obja$ and output signal space $\Objb$, is a relation
    \begin{equation}
        \relA \subseteq \Obja^\Time \times \Objb^\Time.
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Fix a totally ordered set $\Time = \tup{\Time, \leq}$.
    The category $\textbf{Bh}_\Time$ of input-output behaviors is the category where:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Objects consist of all sets of the form $\Obja^\Time$, ranging over all sets $\Obja$.
        \item Morphisms from $\Obja^\Time$ to $\Objb^\Time$ are relations from $\Obja^\Time$ to $\Objb^\Time$:
              \begin{equation}
                  \HomSet{\textbf{Bh}_\Time}{\Obja^\Time}{\Objb^\Time} = \powerset (\Obja^\Time \times \Objb^\Time).
              \end{equation}
        \item The identity morphism at an object $\Obja^\Time$ is the usual identity relation from $\Obja^\Time$ to itself.
        \item Composition is the usual composition of relations.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Sometimes we will wish to consider signal spaces $\Obja$ which are vector spaces over some field $\field$.
Then the set $\Obja^\Time$ naturally inherits a $\field$-vector space structure from $\Obja$, and we may consider input-output behaviors
\begin{equation*}
    \relA \subseteq \Obja^\Time \oplus \Objb^\Time
\end{equation*}
which are $\field$-linear relations.

\begin{definition}
    Fix a totally ordered set $\Time = \tup{\Time, \leq}$.
    The category $\textbf{LBh}_\Time$ of $\field$-linear input-output behaviors is the category where:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Objects consist of all $\field$-vector spaces of the form $\Obja^\Time$, ranging over all $\field$-vector spaces $\Obja$.
        \item Morphisms from $\Obja^\Time$ to $\Objb^\Time$ are linear subspaces of  $\Obja^\Time \oplus \Objb^\Time$.
        \item The identity morphism at an object $\Obja^\Time$ is the usual identity relation from $\Obja^\Time$ to itself (this is always $\field$-linear).
        \item Composition is the usual composition of relations.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Causal behaviors}

Given a signal $\ela \in \Obja^\Time$, we set the notation
\begin{equation}
    \ela \vert_{\leq t} :=  \ela \vert_{\{ s \in \Time \mid s \leq t\}}.
\end{equation}

\begin{definition}
    An input-output behavior $\relA \subseteq \Obja^\Time \times \Objb^\Time$ is \emph{causal} if for all~$\tup{\ela_1, \elb_1}$, $\tup{\ela_2, \elb_2} \in \relA$ holds:
    \begin{equation}
        \forall t \in \Time: \ela_1 \vert_{ \leq t} = \ela_2 \vert_{ \leq t} \  \Rightarrow \ \elb_1 \vert_{ \leq t} = \elb_2 \vert_{ \leq t}
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\todotext{Questions: If two composable input-output behaviors are causal, is their composition also causal?
    What if only one of them is causal?
    And various other related questions.
    .. }

\subsection{Time-invariance}

In this subsection we assume that $\Time = \tup{\Time, \leq}$ comes equipped with a semigroup structure $\tup{\Time, +}$ which is compatible with the total order: if $t \leq t'$ and $s \leq s'$, then $t + s \leq t' + s'$.

Fix an $s \in \Time$.
For any signal space $\Obja$, we define a shift function $\delta_s: \Obja^\Time \to \Obja^\Time$ by
\begin{equation}
    (\delta_s \ela)(t) := \ela(t + s).
\end{equation}

\begin{definition}
    An input-output behavior $\relA \subseteq \Obja^\Time \times \Objb^\Time$ is \emph{time-invariant} if
    \begin{equation}
        \forall s \in \Time: \tup{\ela, \elb} \in \relA  \ \Rightarrow \tup{\delta_s \ela, \delta_s \elb} \in \relA.
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

    What if only one of them is causal?
    And various other related questions.
