    We have seen that (semi)categories have a built-in notion of horizontal composition and that there is also a notion of parallelism using ``vertical stacking''.
    Some (semi)categories have also a ``feedback structure'', which can be used to ``close the loop'' in diagrams.
    In control systems, this is called ``feedback'' because some signals are fed back into the system.
    In other categories, such as \DP, this feedback can be used to model recursive constraints.
