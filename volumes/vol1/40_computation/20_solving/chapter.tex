\chaptersecond{{Solving finite co-design problems}}{chapter-yodel}{chap:solving}{

    In this chapter we discuss the solution of \emph{finite} design problem.
    A finite co-design problem is one in which the upper set of the solutions can be described as the upper closure of a finite antichain.
    Therefore, the solution can be represented with finite memory.

    \iflabelexists{chap:udp}{
        Later, in \cref{chap:udp}, we will see how to deal with non-finite design problems.
