\chaptersecond{{From mathematics to computation}}{chapter-snow}{chap:from-math-to-implementation}{

    In this chapter we discuss the transition from mathematical models to algorithms.
    We frame the discussion as a progression of four phases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The mathematical phase: the world of pure math.
        \item The constructive phase: where we make sure that at least the problems we want to solve have a constructive solution.
        \item The algorithmic phase: where we deal with a well-specified algorithm on a particular computational substrate.
        \item The implementation phase: what happens close to the metal and when dealing with resource constraints.
    \end{itemize}
