\chaptersecond{{From mathematical models to algorithms}}{chapter-snow}{chap:from-math-to-implementation}{

	In this chapter we discuss the transition from mathematical models to algorithms.
	We frame the discussion as a progression of four phases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The mathematical phase: the world of pure math.
		\item The constructive phase: where we make sure that at least the problems we want to solve have a constructive solution.
		\item The algorithmic phase: where we deal with a well-specified algorithm on a particular computational substrate.
		\item The implementation phase: what happens close to the metal and when dealing with resource constraints.
	\end{itemize}
