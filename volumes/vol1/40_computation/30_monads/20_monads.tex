\section{Monads}
\label{sec:monads}

In the previous section we considered the operation of taking the powerset of a set. This was used to think about generalized sets and generalized functions: given a set $\setA$, we thought of its powerset $\powerset \setA$ as a set whose elements -- subsets of $\setA$ -- are ``generalized elements of $\setA$''. Furthermore we saw that it was possible to generalize a function $\mora : \setA \mto \setB$ to a function $\widehat \mora:  \setA \mto \powerset \setB$, and that such generalized functions could be composed. In this section we will see that this construction is possible because the operation of ``taking the powerset'' has a special structure to it: it is an example of a \emph{monad}. 

Before introducing the the general definition, let us approach this concept by listing each of the properties the make the ``powerset operation''  a monad. 

Firstly, note that the ``powerset operation'' can be viewed as functor $\Set \mto \Set$. For each object -- that is, for each set $\setA$ -- it produces a new set, $\powerset \setA$. For each function $\mora: \setA \mto \setB$ we define $\powerset \mora : \powerset \setA \mto \powerset \setB$ by... .

[INSERT EXERCISE: check that this is a functor]


Second, as noted in the previous section, each element ... can be viewed as a generalized element ... So we have, for each set, a function... 
Furthremore, these maps are ``coherent'' with morphisms in $\Set$ in the sense that ...  In other words, the diagram ... commutes. This means precisely that the maps ... are the components of a natural transformation .... . 

Third, consider the question of how to compose generalized morphisms -- that is, how to define the mape \emph{fish}...

\begin{ctdefinition}[Monad]
  \label{def:monad}
  Let \CatC be a category. A \emph{monad} on \CatC is specified by:
  \constit
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item A functor~$ \monA \colon \CatC \fto \CatC$;
    \item A natural transformation~$\monunit \colon \funid_\CatC \nto \monA$, called the \emph{unit};
    \item A natural transformation~$\moncomp \colon \monAA \nto \monA$, called the \emph{composition} or \emph{multiplication}.
  \end{compactenum}
  \condit
  \begin{compactenum}
 \item \emph{Left and right unitality}: the diagrams
  \begin{center}
    \includesag{55_monad_1}
  \end{center}
  must commute. 
  \item \emph{Associativity}: the diagram
  \begin{center}
    \includesag{55_monad_2}
  \end{center}
  must commute.
  \end{compactenum}
\end{ctdefinition}
\todographics{In the diagram above, can we have Rightarrow without the white filling?}
\todotext{Let's add also the diagrams above in components - more verbose but clearer. }
\todotext{I'm not sure if we every introduced ``whiskering'' and the notation for it (which is used in the diagrams in the definition of a monad). We should check and if needed introduce this in the section on natural transformations.}
