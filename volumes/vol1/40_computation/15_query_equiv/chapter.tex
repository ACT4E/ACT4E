\chaptersecond{\DP queries as functors}{chapter-lucern2}{chap:query-equivalence}{
    In this chapter we show how the two types of queries \FixFunMinRes and \FixResMaxFun can be seen as \emph{functors} from the category \DP to two new categories to be defined that represent the types of ``solutions''.
    The specification of these functors represents a complete solution for \DP optimization at the ``mathematical level'', without taking into account questions of computatibility or resource consumption, which will be explored in the successive chapters.
