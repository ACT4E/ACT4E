\section{Mobility}

For a specific mode of transportation, say a car, we can define a graph
\begin{equation}
    \graph_\mathrm{c}=\tup{
        \verticesn{\mathrm{c}},
        \arcsn{\mathrm{c}},
        \sourcen{\mathrm{c}},
        \targetn{\mathrm{c}}
    },
\end{equation}
where~$\verticesn{\mathrm{c}}$ represents geographical locations which the car can reach and~$\arcsn{\mathrm{c}}$ represents the paths it can take, such as roads.
Similarly, we consider a graph~$\graph_\mathrm{s}=\tup{\verticesn{\mathrm{s}},\arcsn{\mathrm{s}},\sourcen{\mathrm{s}},\targetn{\mathrm{s}}}$, representing the subway system of a city, with stations~$\verticesn{\mathrm{s}}$ and subway lines going through paths~$\arcsn{\mathrm{s}}$, and a graph~$\graph_\mathrm{b}=\tup{\verticesn{\mathrm{b}},\arcsn{\mathrm{b}},\sourcen{\mathrm{b}},\targetn{\mathrm{b}}}$, representing onboarding and off boarding at airports.
In the following, we want to express intermodality: the phenomenon that someone might travel to a certain intermediate location in a car and then take the subway to reach their final destination.

By considering the graph~$\graph=(\vertices,\arcs,\source,\target)$ with~$\vertices=\verticesn{\mathrm{c}}\setunion \verticesn{\mathrm{s}}\setunion \verticesn{\mathrm{b}}$ and~$\arcs=\arcsn{\mathrm{c}}\setunion \arcsn{\mathrm{s}}\setunion \arcsn{\mathrm{b}}$, we obtain the desired intermodality graph.
Graph~$\graph$ can be seen as a new category, with objects~$\vertices$ and morphisms~$\arcs$.
\begin{example}
    \label{exa:car-category}
    Consider the \Car category, describing your road trip through Italy and Switzerland, with
    \begin{equation}
        \verticesn{\mathrm{c}}=
        \makeset{
            \FCOc,
            \transmuted{Florence},
            \transmuted{Bologna},
            \MPXc,
            \transmuted{Gotthard},
            \ZRHc
        },
    \end{equation}
    and arrows as in~\cref{fig:carcat}.
    The nodes represent typical touristic road-trip checkpoints in Italy and Switzerland and the arrows represent highways connecting them.

    \begin{figure*}[h!]
        \includesag{30_carcategory}
        \caption{The \Car category.}
        \label{fig:carcat}
    \end{figure*}

    Furthermore, consider the \Flight category with
    \begin{equation}
        \vertices_\mathrm{f}
        = \makeset{
            \FCOf,
            \LIN,
            \MPXf,
            \ZRHf
        }
    \end{equation}
    and arrows as in~\cref{fig:flight}.
    The nodes represent airports in Italy and Switzerland and the arrows represent connections, offered by specific flight companies.

    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includesag{30_flight}
        \caption{The \Flight category.}
        \label{fig:flight}
    \end{figure}

    We then consider the \Board category, with nodes
    \begin{equation}
        \vertices_\mathrm{b}=\makeset{\FCOf,\FCOc,\MPXf,\MPXc,\ZRHf,\ZRHc}
    \end{equation}
    and arrows as in~\cref{fig:boarding}.
    Nodes represent airports and airport parking lots, and arrows represent the onboarding and off boarding paths we have to walk to get from the parking lot to the airport and vice-versa.

    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includesag{30_boarding}
        \caption{The \Board category. }
        \label{fig:boarding}
    \end{figure}

    The combination of the three, which we call the \emph{intermodal graph}, can be represented as a graph, in which we use dashed arrows for intermodal morphisms, arising from composition of morphisms involving multiple modes (\cref{fig:intermodal}).
    Imagine that you are in the parking lot of \ZRH airport and you want to reach \transmuted{Florence}.
    From there, you can onboard to a \transmuter{Swiss} flight to~$\FCOf$, will then offboard reaching the parking lot~$\FCOc$, and drive on highway \transmuter{A1} reaching \transmuted{Florence}.
    This is intermodality.

    \begin{figure*}[h!]
        \centering
        \scalebox{0.9}{
            \includesag{30_intermodal}
        }
        \caption{Intermodal graph.
            The dashed arrows represent intermodal morphisms, and we depict just one of them for simplicity.
        }
        \label{fig:intermodal}
    \end{figure*}
\end{example}

The intermodal network category~\Intermodal is the free category on the graph illustrated in \cref{fig:intermodal}.
