    Culture is what you don't think about.
    Mathematics has a quite different culture than engineering.
    Engineering is about getting things to work \emph{in practice}.
    Conventions are important.
    Specifics of protocols are important.
    In mathematics, certain things just not matter: one studies what is true regardless of conventions.
