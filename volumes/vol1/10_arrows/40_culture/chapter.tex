	Culture is what you don't think about.
	Mathematics has a quite different culture than engineering.
	Engineering is about getting things to work \emph{in practice}.
	Conventions are important.
	Specifics of protocols are important.
	In mathematics, certain things just not matter: one studies what is true regardless of conventions.
