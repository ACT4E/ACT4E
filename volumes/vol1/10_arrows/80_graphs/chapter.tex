\chaptersecond{Graphs}{chapter-rosti}{chap:graphs}{
    In this chapter we give a formal description of graphs.
    The relation between graphs and categories might be confusing at first---there is a lot of overlap.
    Both are composed of ``points and arrows''.
    A graph is best thought of a \emph{data structure}: a list of nodes and edges.
    This data structure could be used to describe a category.
    But a category is something more: it has a closure property (all arrows compositions exist) and a constraint (composition is associative).
    A graph needs not have these properties.
