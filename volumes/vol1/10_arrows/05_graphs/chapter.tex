\chaptersecond{Graphs}{chapter-rosti}{chap:graphs}{
    In this chapter we give a formal description of graphs.
    Graphs are data structures with ``points'' and ``arrows'': it is the first time we encounter a data structure with two kinds of elements.
}
% \devel{
%     The relation between graphs and categories might be confusing at first---there is a lot of overlap.
%     Both are composed of ``points and arrows''.
%     A graph is best thought of a \emph{data structure}: a list of nodes and edges.
%     This data structure could be used to describe a category.
%     But a category is something more: it has a closure property (all arrows compositions exist) and a constraint (composition is associative).
%     A graph needs not have these properties.
%     \todotext{\alphubel: It is weird to say it here because we haven't introduced categories.}
