\chaptersecond{Constructing categories}{chapter-swissair}{chap:construct-cat}{
    In this chapter we discuss various ways of building new categories from old ones.
    Given categories~\CatC and~\CatD, we will see how to build their \SY{cartesian product}~$\CatC \Ctimes \CatD$ and their direct sum~$\CatC \Cplus \CatD$, respectively.
    In addition to these constructions, we will see how to start with a category~\CatC and construct its \emph{opposite category}~$\CatCop$, as well as various other categories derived from~\CatC by thinking of kinds of diagrams in~\CatC as objects themselves.
