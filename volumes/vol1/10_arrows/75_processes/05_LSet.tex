\section{The category $\cCat{\Set}$}

We will define a category $\cCat{\Set}$ whose objects are ``sets of tuples''.


%\subsection{Lists}
%
%Before defining L-sets, let's first recall our notion of lists.
%Given three things, for example (call them $\ela$, $\elb$, and $\elc$) we can list them in some order:
%\begin{equation}
%    [\elb, \elc, \ela].
%\end{equation}
%The square brackets are our notation for lists, and recall that the ordering matters for lists (for instance, $[\elc, \ela, \elb]$ is a different list of those same three things).
%
%Any list has a length; for example $[\elb, \elc, \ela]$ has length 3.
%For us, by definition, all lists have finite length.
%We also define such a thing as an \emph{empty list}, which we denote by $[ \ ]$.
%It has length zero.
%
%The things in a list -- for example, $\elb$, $\elc$, and $\ela$ -- are the \emph{entries} of the list.
%They each come with an index corresponding to their placement in the list (so we can speak of the 1st entry, 2nd entry, and so on).

Given sets $\setA_1, \setA_2, \dots , \setA_n$, if they are all non-empty, then we define
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sets-of-tuples}
   \cObj{\setA_1, \setA_2, \dots, \setA_n} := \{ \tup{\ela_1, \ela_2, \dots, \ela_n} \mid \ela_1 \in \setA_1, \ela_2 \in \setA_2, \dots, \ela_n \in \setA_n \}.
\end{equation}
So for example, 
\begin{equation}
    \cObj{\wnumbers, \natnumbers, \reals} = \{ \tup{\ela, \elb, \elc} \mid \ela \in \wnumbers, \elb \in \natnumbers, \elc \in \reals \}.
\end{equation}



Essentially, the objects of $\cCat{\Set}$ will be sets of the form \cref{eq:sets-of-tuples}. We also include the empty set $\Emptyset$ as an object of $\cCat{\Set}$, as well as a special one-element set $\stylesets{[ \ ]} := \{ \tup{} \}$ whose single element is the empty tuple. 

Furthermore, we make the convention that $ \cObj{\setA_1, \setA_2, \dots, \setA_n}$ denotes the empty set if any of the sets $\setA_1, \setA_2, \dots , \setA_n$ are equal to the empty set. 



All of the objects of $\cCat{\Set}$ are in particular just sets, so we can package them into a category whose morphisms are simply functions between sets.

\begin{ctdefinition}[\cCat{\Set}]
    The category \cCat{\Set} is:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Objects: L-sets;
        \item Morphisms: ordinary functions between L-sets;
        \item Composition: composition of functions;
        \item Identities: identity functions.
    \end{itemize}
\end{ctdefinition}

\subsection{From \Set to \cCat{\Set}}

Observe that we can turn any set into an object of \cCat{\Set}: given a set $\setA$, there is the associated set
\begin{equation}
\cObj{\setA} = \{ \tup{\ela} \mid \ela \in \setA \}
\end{equation}
whose elements are precisely all the tuples of length one whose entry is an element of $\setA$. This defines a function
\begin{equation}
\Ob_{\Set} \to \Ob_{\cCat{\Set}}, \setA \mapsto \cObj{\setA}
\end{equation}
which one might call ``bracket''. 

Similarly, given a function $\mora \colon \setA \to \setB$ between sets, there is an associated function $\cMor{ \mora }: \cObj{\setA} \mto \cObj{\setB}$ given by 
\begin{equation}
\cMor{ \mora } ( \tup{ \ela }) := \tup{\mora(a)}.
\end{equation}
This defines a function 
\begin{equation}
\Hom_{\Set}(\setA,\setB) \to \Hom_{\Cat{LSet}}(\stylesets{[\setA]},\stylesets{[\setB]})
\end{equation}
for any sets $\setA$ and $\setB$; one might also call it ``bracket''.





\subsection{Multiplication in \cCat{\Set}}

Given tuples $\tup{\ela, \elb, \elc}$ and $\tup{\eld, \ele}$ we can stick them together to make the longer tuple$\tup{\ela, \elb, \elc, \eld, \ele}$.
We call this operation concatenation, and in the context of \cCat{\Set} we will think of it as a kind of multiplication of tuples.
Our notation for concatenation is
\begin{equation}
    \tup{\ela, \elb, \elc} \tupconcat \tup{\eld, \ele} = \tup{\ela, \elb, \elc, \eld, \ele}.
\end{equation}
For the empty tuple $\tup{  }$ we also have
\begin{equation}
    \tup{} \tupconcat \tup{\ela, \elb, \elc}  = \tup{\ela, \elb, \elc}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \tup{\ela, \elb, \elc}  \tupconcat \tup{ } = \tup{\ela, \elb, \elc}.
\end{equation}

Now we define a multiplication of objects of \cCat{\Set}.
Given $\cObj{\setA_1, \dots, \setA_m}$ and $\cObj{\setB_1,  \dots, \setB_n}$ which are both neither the empty set nor $\cObj{}$, we define
\begin{equation}
   \cObj{\setA_1, \dots, \setA_m} \cprod \cObj{\setB_1, \dots, \setB_n} \definedas \cObj{\setA_1, \dots, \setA_m, \setB_1,  \dots, \setB_n}.
\end{equation}
In other words, the elements of $\cObj{\setA_1, \dots, \setA_m} \cprod \cObj{\setB_1, \dots, \setB_n}$ are all possible concatenations of elements of $\cObj{\setA_1, \dots, \setA_m}$ with elements of $\cObj{\setB_1, \dots, \setB_m}$.

If either $\cObj{\setA_1, \dots, \setA_m}$ or $\cObj{\setB_1, \dots, \setB_n}$ is the empty set, we define $\cObj{\setA_1, \dots, \setA_m} \cprod \cObj{\setB_1, \dots, \setB_n}$ to also be the empty set:
\begin{equation}
    \Emptyset \cprod \cObj{\setB_1, \dots, \setB_n} = \Emptyset
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \cObj{\setA_1, \dots, \setA_m} \cprod \Emptyset = \Emptyset.
\end{equation}

And for $\cObj{}$ we have the following rules:
\begin{equation}
    \stylesets{[ \ ]} \cprod \cObj{\setB_1, \dots, \setB_n} = \cObj{\setB_1,  \dots, \setB_n}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \cObj{\setA_1, \dots, \setA_m} \cprod \stylesets{[ \ ]} = \cObj{\setA_1, \dots, \setA_m}.
\end{equation}
(Note that these rules for multiplying with $\cObj{}$ and the ones for multiplying with $\Emptyset$ are compatible with each other in the cases where they overlap).

\begin{remark}
The multiplication of objects in $\cCat{\Set}$ is associative. 
\end{remark}
