\section{The category~$\cCat{\Set}$}
\label{sec:cartcatset}

We will define a category~$\cCat{\Set}$ whose objects are ``sets of tuples''.

%\subsection{Lists}
%
%Before defining L-sets, let's first recall our notion of lists.
%Given three things, for example (call them $\ela$, $\elb$, and $\elc$) we can list them in some order:
%\begin{equation}
%    [\elb, \elc, \ela].
%\end{equation}
%The square brackets are our notation for lists, and recall that the ordering matters for lists (for instance, $[\elc, \ela, \elb]$ is a different list of those same three things).
%
%Any list has a length; for example $[\elb, \elc, \ela]$ has length 3.
%For us, by definition, all lists have finite length.
%We also define such a thing as an \emph{empty list}, which we denote by $[ \ ]$.
%It has length zero.
%
%The things in a list -- for example, $\elb$, $\elc$, and $\ela$ -- are the \emph{entries} of the list.
%They each come with an index corresponding to their placement in the list (so we can speak of the 1st entry, 2nd entry, and so on).

Given sets~$\setAn{1}, \setAn{2}, \ldots , \setAn{n}$, if they are all non-empty, then we define
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sets-of-tuples}
    \cObj{\setAn{1}, \setAn{2}, \ldots, \setAn{n}} \definedas \{ \tup{\elna{1}, \elna{2}, \ldots, \elna{n}} \mid \elna{1} \in \setAn{1}, \elna{2} \in \setAn{2}, \ldots, \elna{n} \in \setAn{n} \}.
\end{equation}
So for example,
\begin{equation*}
    \cObj{\wnumbers, \natnumbers, \reals} = \{ \tup{\ela, \elb, \elc} \mid \ela \in \wnumbers, \elb \in \natnumbers, \elc \in \reals \}.
\end{equation*}

Essentially, the objects of~$\cCat{\Set}$ will be sets of the form \cref{eq:sets-of-tuples}.
We also include the empty set~$\Emptyset$ as an object of~$\cCat{\Set}$, as well as a special one-element set~$\stylesets{[ \ ]} \definedas \{ \tup{} \}$ whose single element is the empty tuple.

We make the convention that~$\cObj{\setAn{1}, \setAn{2}, \ldots, \setAn{n}}$ denotes the empty set if any of the sets~$\setAn{1}, \setAn{2}, \ldots , \setAn{n}$ are equal to the empty set.
In particular, we have for example  $\Emptyset = \cObj{\Emptyset}$.

All of the objects of~$\cCat{\Set}$ are in particular just sets, so we can package them into a category whose morphisms are simply functions between sets.

\begin{ctdefinition}[\cCat{\Set}]
    The category \cCat{\Set} is:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Objects: sets which can be represented as~$\cObj{\setAn{1}, \setAn{2}, \ldots, \setAn{n}}$, for any $n \in \natnumbers$ and any sets $\setAn{1}, \setAn{2}, \ldots, \setAn{n}$;
        \item Morphisms: ordinary functions between sets;
        \item Composition: the usual composition of functions;
        \item Identities: identity functions.
    \end{itemize}
\end{ctdefinition}

\subsection{From \Set to $\cCat{\Set}$}

Observe that we can turn any set into an object of $\cCat{\Set}$: given a set~$\setA$, there is the associated set
\begin{equation*}
    \cObj{\setA} = \{ \tup{\ela} \mid \ela \in \setA \}
\end{equation*}
whose elements are precisely all the tuples of length one whose entry is an element of~$\setA$.
This defines a function
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        \Ob_{\Set} & \to \Ob_{\cCat{\Set}} \\
        \setA      & \mapsto \cObj{\setA}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
%\Ob_{\Set} \to \Ob_{\cCat{\Set}}, \setA \mapsto \cObj{\setA}
which one might call ``bracket''.

Similarly, given a function~$\mapa \colon \setA \to \setB$ between sets, there is an associated function~$\cMor{ \mapa }\colon \cObj{\setA} \mto \cObj{\setB}$ given by
\begin{equation*}
    \cMor{ \mapa } ( \tup{ \ela }) \definedas \tup{\mapa(a)}.
\end{equation*}
This defines a function
\begin{equation*}
    \Hom_{\Set}(\setA,\setB) \to \Hom_{\cCat{\Set}}(\cObj{\setA},\cObj{\setB})
\end{equation*}
for any sets~$\setA$ and~$\setB$; one might also call it ``bracket''.

\subsection{Concatenation of tuples}

Given tuples~$\tup{\ela, \elb, \elc}$ and~$\tup{\eld, \ele}$ we can stick them together to make the longer tuple~$\tup{\ela, \elb, \elc, \eld, \ele}$.
We call this operation concatenation, and in the context of \cCat{\Set} we think of it as a kind of multiplication.
Our notation for concatenation of tuples is
\begin{equation*}
    \tup{\ela, \elb, \elc} \tupconcat \tup{\eld, \ele} = \tup{\ela, \elb, \elc, \eld, \ele}.
\end{equation*}
For the empty tuple~$\tup{  }$ we set
\begin{equation*}
    \tup{} \tupconcat \tup{\ela, \elb, \elc}  = \tup{\ela, \elb, \elc}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
    \tup{\ela, \elb, \elc}  \tupconcat \tup{ } = \tup{\ela, \elb, \elc}.
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Multiplication in \cCat{\Set}}

We define a multiplication for objects of \cCat{\Set}.
The symbol~$\cprod$ will denote this multiplication in infix notation.

Given~$\cObj{\setAn{1}, \ldots, \setAn{m}}$ and~$\cObj{\setBn{1},  \ldots, \setBn{n}}$ we define
an operation
\begin{equation*}
    \cprod \colon \Ob_{\cCat{\Set}} \times \Ob_{\cCat{\Set}} \to \Ob_{\cCat{\Set}}
\end{equation*}
by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:strict-monoidal-product-sets}
    \cObj{\setAn{1}, \ldots, \setAn{m}} \cprod \cObj{\setBn{1}, \ldots, \setBn{n}} \definedas \cObj{\setAn{1}, \ldots, \setAn{m}, \setBn{1},  \ldots, \setBn{n}}
\end{equation}
for any $n, m \in \natnumbers$.

When both factors are non-empty, the elements of~$\cObj{\setAn{1}, \ldots, \setAn{m}} \cprod \cObj{\setBn{1}, \ldots, \setBn{n}}$ are all possible concatenations of elements of~$\cObj{\setAn{1}, \ldots, \setAn{m}}$ with elements of~$\cObj{\setBn{1}, \ldots, \setBn{n}}$.

Equation \cref{eq:strict-monoidal-product-sets} holds in particular also in the cases when~$m = 0$ or~$n =0$:
\begin{equation*}
    \cObj{ \ } \cprod \cObj{\setBn{1}, \ldots, \setBn{n}} = \cObj{\setBn{1}, \ldots, \setBn{n}}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
    \cObj{\setAn{1}, \ldots, \setAn{m}} \cprod \cObj{ \ } = \cObj{\setAn{1}, \ldots, \setAn{m}}.
\end{equation*}

Also, writing $\Emptyset = \cObj{\Emptyset}$ we find that
\begin{equation*}
    \cObj{\setAn{1}, \ldots, \setAn{m}} \cprod \Emptyset = \Emptyset
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
    \Emptyset \cprod \cObj{\setBn{1}, \ldots, \setBn{n}} = \Emptyset.
\end{equation*}

\begin{remark}
    The multiplication of objects in~$\cCat{\Set}$ is associative (which was our goal with making this construction).
    Indeed, both
    \begin{equation*}
        ( \cObj{\setAn{1}, \ldots, \setAn{l}} \cprod \cObj{\setBn{1}, \ldots, \setBn{m}}) \cprod \cObj{\setCn{1}, \ldots, \setCn{n}}
    \end{equation*}
    and
    \begin{equation*}
        \cObj{\setAn{1}, \ldots, \setAn{l}} \cprod (\cObj{\setBn{1}, \ldots, \setBn{m}} \cprod \cObj{\setCn{1}, \ldots, \setCn{n}})
    \end{equation*}
    are equal to
    \begin{equation*}
        \cObj{\setAn{1}, \ldots, \setAn{l}, \setBn{1}, \ldots, \setBn{m}, \setCn{1}, \ldots, \setCn{n}}.
    \end{equation*}
\end{remark}
