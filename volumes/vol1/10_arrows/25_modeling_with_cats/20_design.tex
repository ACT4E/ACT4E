\section{Resources dependencies}
\label{sec:dependencies-design}

In engineering design, one creates \emph{systems} out of \emph{components}.
Each component has a reason to be in there.
We will show how category theory can help in formalizing the chains of causality that underlie a certain design.

We will need to reason at the level of abstraction where we consider the ``function'', or ``functionality'', which each component provides, and the ``requirements'' that are needed to provide the function.

We will start with a simple example of the functioning principle of an electric car.

In an electric car, there is a battery, a store of the electric energy resource.
We can see the production of motion as the chain of two transformations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \motor transmutes the \electricpower into \rotationalmotion.
    \item The \rotationalmotion is converted into \translationalmotion by the \wheels and their friction with the road.
\end{itemize}

We see that there are two types of things in this example:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The ``transmuted'': the \electricpower, the \rotationalmotion, the \translationalmotion: these are objects in a category of transmuted resources.
    \item The ``transmuters'': the \motor and \wheels: these are morphisms in a category of transmuted resources.
\end{enumerate}

For a first qualitative description of the scenario, we might choose to just keep track of what is transmuted into what.
We can draw a diagram in which each resource is a point (\cref{fig:e1}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{30_dpcatfig_e1}
    \caption{Resources in the electric car example.}
    \label{fig:e1}
\end{figure}

Now, we can draw arrows between two points if there is a transmuter between them.

We choose the direction of the arrow such that
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:arrow1}
    \middlesag{generic_transmuter}
\end{equation}
means that ``using \transmuter{transmuter}, having~$\transmuted{Y}$ is sufficient to produce~$\transmuted{X}$''.

\begin{remark}[Are we going the wrong direction?]
    The chosen direction for the arrows is completely the opposite of what you would expect if you thought about ``input and outputs''.
    There is a good reason to use this convention, though it will be apparent only a few chapters later.
    In the meantime, it is a good exercise to liberate your mind about the preconception of what an arrow means; in category theory there will be categories where the arrows represent much more abstract concepts than input/output.
\end{remark}

Another way to write \cref{eq:arrow1} would be as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    \transmuter{transmuter} \colon \transmuted{X} \mto \transmuted{Y}.
\end{equation*}
% This is now something syntactically familiar; when we study the categories of sets and functions between sets we will see that in that context the familiar meaning is also the correct meaning.

With these conventions, we can describe the two transmuters as these arrows:
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:transmutation_example}
    \begin{aligned}
        \motor  & :  \rotationalmotion \mto \electricpower, \\
        \wheels & : \translationalmotion \mto \rotationalmotion.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
We can put these arrows in the diagrams, and obtain the following (\cref{fig:e2}).
% In this simple setting, we can identify the key systems and subsystems: car, engine, axle, wheels, and road.

% \AC{we don't refer to these subsystems later}

% We can identify the functionality/resources of interest as:~\textsf{electric} \textsf{power}, \textsf{rotational} \textsf{motion}, and~\textsf{translational} \textsf{motion}. Note that each of these quantities plays a dual role. For example, the \textsf{rotational motion} is something which is produced by the motor, so it is a functionality for the motor, while it is a resource for axle/wheels, because they need it to provide~$\mathsf{translational}\ \mathsf{motion}$.

% Furthermore, we can draw an arrow between two resources if we can obtain one from the other. In the example, we have described how \textsf{electric power} becomes \textsf{rotational motion}, described by the \textsf{engine} arrow, and how \textsf{rotational motion} becomes \textsf{translational motion}, described by the \textsf{wheel} arrow (\cref{fig:e2}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{30_dpcatfig_e2}
    \caption{Transmuters are arrows between resources.}
    \label{fig:e2}
\end{figure}

In this representation, the arrows are the components of the system.
%We will learn how to compose these arrows according to the rules of category theory.
The basic rule is \emph{composition}.
If we use the semantics that an arrow from resource~$X$ to resource~$Y$ means ``having~$Y$ is enough to obtain~$X$'', then, since~$Y$ is enough for~$Y$ per definition, we can add a self-loop for each resource.
We will call the self-loops \emph{identities} (\cref{fig:e3}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{30_dpcatfig_e3}
    \caption{System components and identities. }
    \label{fig:e3}
\end{figure}

\showslides{
    \begin{forslides}
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:30_dpcatfig_e4_noid}
            \includesag{30_dpcatfig_e4_noid}
        \end{equation}
    \end{forslides}
}

Furthermore, we might consider the idea of composition of arrows.
Suppose that we know that
%
\begin{equation*}
    \transmuted{X} \stackrel{\mora}{\mto} \transmuted{Y}
    \qqand
    \transmuted{Y} \stackrel{\morb}{\mto} \transmuted{Z},
\end{equation*}
%
that is, using a~$\morb$ we can get a~$\transmuted{Y}$ from a~$\transmuted{Z}$, and using a~$\mora$ we can get a~$\transmuted{X}$ from a~$\transmuted{Y}$, then we conclude that using a~$\mora$ and a~$\morb$ we can get an~$\transmuted{X}$ from a~$\transmuted{Z}$.

In our example, if the arrows \wheels  and \motor exist, then also the arrow ``\wheels then \motor'' exists~(\cref{fig:e4}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{30_dpcatfig_e4}
    \caption{Composition of system components. }
    \label{fig:e4}
\end{figure}

So far, we have drawn only one arrow between two points, but we can draw as many as we want.
If we want to distinguish between different brands of motors, we would just draw one arrow for each model.
For example,~\cref{fig:e4bis} shows two models of motors (\transmuter{motor A}, and \transmuter{motor B}) and two models of wheels (\transmuter{wheels U} and \transmuter{wheels V}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{20_wheel_motor_options}
    \caption{Multiple models for wheels and motors.}
    \label{fig:e4bis}
\end{figure}

The figure implies now the existence of \emph{four} composed arrows: ``\transmuter{wheels U} then \transmuter{motor A}'', ``\transmuter{wheels U} then \transmuter{motor B}'', ``\transmuter{wheels V} then \transmuter{motor A}'', and ``\transmuter{wheels V} then \transmuter{motor B}'', all going from \translationalmotion to \electricpower;

%A ``category`` is an abstract mathematical structure that captures the properties of these systems of points and arrows and the logic of composition.

%The basic terminology is that the points are called \textbf{objects}, and the arrows are called \textbf{morphisms}.

%In our example, the \motor and the \wheels are the morphisms, and \electricpower, \rotationalmotion, \translationalmotion are the objects.

%Many things can be defined as categories and we will see many examples in this book.

Note that we may save some ink when drawing diagrams of morphisms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We do not need to draw the identity arrows from one object to itself, because, by \cref{def:categorymain}, they always exist.
          %However, we will see how there might be multiple such loops.
    \item  Given arrows~$\Obja \mto \Objb$ and~$\Objb \mto \Objc$, we do not need to draw their composition because, by \cref{def:categorymain}, this composition is guaranteed to exist.
\end{itemize}

With these conventions, we can just draw the arrows \motor and \wheels in the diagram, and the rest of the diagram is implied (\cref{fig:e5}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{30_dpcatfig_e5}
    \caption{
        Electric car example.
        The \textcolor{gray}{gray} arrows are implied by the properties of a category.
    }
    \label{fig:e5}
\end{figure}

In particular, the electric car example corresponds to the category~\CatC specified by
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Objects:} $\ObC=\makeset{ \electricpower,\rotationalmotion,\translationalmotion}$.
    \item \emph{Morphisms}: The system components are the morphisms.
          For instance, we have \motor, \wheels, and the morphism $\wheels \mthen \motor$, implied by the properties of the category.
\end{itemize}

We can slightly expand this example by noting the reverse transformations.
In an electric car it is possible to regenerate power; that is, we can obtain \rotationalmotion of the \wheels from \translationalmotion (via the morphism \move), and then convert the \rotationalmotion into \electricpower (via the morphism \dynamo)~(\cref{fig:e6},~\cref{fig:e6-together}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{30_dpcatfig_e6}
    \caption{Electric power can be produced from motion.}
    \label{fig:e6}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{30_dpcatfig_e7}
    \caption{Electric car example: forward and backward transformations.\label{fig:e6-together}}
\end{figure}

Given the semantics of the arrows in a category, all compositions of arrows exist, even if they are not drawn explicitly.
For example, we can consider the composition
%
\begin{equation}
    \wheels \mthen \motor \mthen \dynamo \mthen \move,
\end{equation}
%
which converts \translationalmotion into \rotationalmotion, into \electricpower, then back to \rotationalmotion and \translationalmotion.
Note that this is an arrow that has the same head and tail as the identity arrow on \translationalmotion~(\cref{fig:e8}).
However, these two arrows are not necessarily the same.
In this example we are representing physical systems, so we would in fact not expect them to be the same, since there will be some losses during the many conversions.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesag{30_dpcatfig_e8}
    \caption{There can be multiple morphisms from an object to itself.}
    \label{fig:e8}
\end{figure}

The directionality of the arrows is also important.
While the convention of which resource is the tail and which the head is just a typographic convention, it might be the case that we know how to convert one resource into another, but not vice versa.
\Cref{fig:e10} shows an example of a diagram that describes a process which is definitely not invertible.

    \centering
    \includesag{30_dpcatfig_e10}
    \caption{An example of a process which is not invertible. }
    \label{fig:e10}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
    Given any category~\CatC, and any object~$\Obja\setin \CatC$, the set of \emph{endomorphisms}~$\HomSet{\CatC}{\Obja}{\Obja}$ is a monoid.
    The category depicted in \cref{fig:monoid_endomorphisms} has three objects~$\Obja,\Objb,\Objc$ and several morphisms.~$\Obja$ has four endomorphisms,~$\Objb$ two, and~$\Objc$ three (including identity morphisms).
    Take the binary operation~$\mtimes$ to be the composition~$\mthen$ in~\CatC, and the neutral element to be the identity~$\catidat\Obja$.
    The associativity and unitality laws of the category~\CatC coincide with the ones of the monoid's definition, and are satisfied.
    Therefore, we can identify a monoid as a one-object category.
\end{example}
