\chaptersecond{(Semi)categories}{chapter-lucerne}{chap:category}{
    In this chapter we look at the fundamental notion of a category, and also its cousin, the notion of semicategory.
    We will see that categories generalize many of
    mathematical structures that we have studied in this book so far.

    Although categories are more of a protagonist in this book, we introduce semicategories first because they are more rudimentary.
    The step from semicategories to categories will then be very similar to the step from \SY{semigroups} to monoids.
