\chaptersecond{(Semi)categories}{chapter-lucerne}{chap:category}{
    In this chapter we look at the fundamental notion of a category, and also its cousin, the notion of \SY{semicategory}.
    We will see that categories generalize many of
    mathematical structures that we have studied in this book so far.

    Although categories are more of a protagonist in this book, we introduce \SY{semicategories} first because they are more rudimentary.
    The step from \SY{semicategories} to categories will then be very similar to the step from \SY{semigroups} to \SY{monoids}.
