\chaptersecond{\statusdraft{\wHomos and actions}}{placeholder}{
}{
In this chapter we look at \whomos, which are maps between two semigroups (or monoids, groups)
that ``preserve the structure''. We also look at \emph{actions}, which describe some form
of compositional effects of a semigroup into another set.
