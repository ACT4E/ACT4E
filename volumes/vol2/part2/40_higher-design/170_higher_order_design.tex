\begin{remark}
  In \cref{lem:dpboundedlattice}, we showed that $\HomSet{\DP}{\F{A}}{\R{B}}$ is a bounded lattice, and in particular a poset. The fact that $\Hom_\DP$ is a poset means that design problems in $\Hom_\DP(A,B)$ can be counted as functionalities and/or resources in a design problem.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
  \label{ex:rd}
  Jeb's Spaceship Parts lost their last contract to Starshow Bob after submitting a completely inferior engine in every respect ($\text{Jeb-XX} \Imp \text{Bob-Roc}$). In response, they've decided to invest heavily in R\&D, which can be thought of as a design problem of its own: Given time and money as resources, what kind of engine technology can they produce as a `functionality'?
\end{example}
