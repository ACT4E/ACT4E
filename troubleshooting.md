    I'm using the xr package to cross-reference a label defined in another document, but I get the error:
    ! Argument of \@fifthoffive has an extra }
    This is the same kind of problem as the previous one, but in this case the \label has been defined in a file that doesn't include the hyperref package, but the document referencing it does.
