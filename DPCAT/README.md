# Article class


Here you can find the compositionalityarticle class, as well as an article template. 

## Bugs and issues
If you encounter any problems using this class please analyse the error message carefully and look for help online; http://tex.stackexchange.com/ is an excellent resource.
If you cannot resolve a problem,  open a bug report in our bug-tracker under https://github.com/compositionality/latex-template/issues. You should provide the full source of a minimal working LaTeX file that reproduces the problem, as well as the log file showing the error to help you. Bug reports without minimal working examples will be ignored. You can also contact us via email under executive@compositionality-journal.org, but it may take significantly longer to get a response.
