\section*{Meta}

\noindent
Exam date: 27.08.2021 \\
Exam time: 10:00 -- 11:30  (1.5 hours) \\ 
Exam place: HG E 7 \\
Allowed materials: open book (laptops, phones, internet?)

\

\noindent
Aims of the exam: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Test familiarity with and understanding of basic definitions from the course
\item Test proficiency in basic mathematical skills relating to proving statements, reasoning, and problem-solving
\item Test the understanding of interconnections between various concepts introduced in the course, and the ability to transfer knowledge
\item Test the understanding of the "compositional way of thinking" and the use of category theory concepts in connection with applied examples
\end{enumerate}

\

\noindent
Desired properties of the exam: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Have more questions than are expected by any average or slightly above average student to be solved in the given 1.5 hours (we can then grade on a curve), in order to account for uncertainty in how difficult we judge the exam to be. 
\item On the other hand we should not have too too many questions, because otherwise the grading work will be disproportionally large in proportion to the number of students. 
\item Include some multiple choice questions as a way to provide students with a quick means to gain points and to reduce correction work. 
\item Include some problems that ask for mathematical proofs. 
\item Include some problems that have an applied flavor. 
\item Include at least one problem that is challenging and requires some creative problem solving. 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Draft Exam 1}


\begin{gradedexercise}[\exname{MonotoneMaps}]\label{ex:MonotoneMaps}
 (4 points) Consider the posets $\tup{\posA, \leq_\posA}$ and $\tup{\posB, \leq_\posB}$, described respectively by the following Hasse diagrams. 
 
\begin{equation}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{pics/ExamPosets.png}
\end{equation}

The following is a list of diagrams of functions $\posA \to \posB$. We'll refer to them by $\mapa_1$, $\mapa_2$, $\mapa_3$ and $\mapa_4$, respectively. 

\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{pics/ExamPosetMap4.png}
\end{equation}


\begin{enumerate}
\item (4 points) Which of the functions $\mapa_1$, $\mapa_2$, $\mapa_3$ and $\mapa_4$ are monotone functions? 
\item (2 points) The set of all monotone maps from $\tup{\posA, \leq_\posA}$ to $\tup{\posB, \leq_\posB}$ can itself be given a poset structure (i.e. a partial order) in a straightforward way. How is this partial order defined? 
%\item (2 points) We can think of any poset as a special kind of category. If we think of posets as categories, then functors between them correspond to monotone functions. Natural transformations relate one functor to another; in the world of posets and monotone functions, what do natural transformations correspond to? 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{gradedexercise}[\exname{UpperLowerPreimage}]\label{ex:UpperLowerPreimage}
Let $\tup{\posA, \leq_\posA}$ be a poset and let $\Bool$ denote the set $\{ \false, \true \}$ equipped with the partial order such that $\false \leq \true$. Let $\mapa : \posA \to \Bool$ be a monotone map and consider the set 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:preimage-of-false}
\mapa^{-1}(\false) = \{ \ela \in \posA \mid \mapa(\ela) = \false \}.
\end{equation}
Is the set $\cref{eq:preimage-of-false}$ an upper set, a lower set, or neither?

\begin{gradedexercise}[\exname{FreeCatOnGraph}]\label{ex:FreeCatOnGraph}
 Consider the following five graphs. In the course, we introduced the notion of the \emph{free category on a graph}. If $G$ is a graph, we denote the free category on $G$ by $\Free(G)$. For each graph $G$ below, how many morphisms in total are there in the associated category~$\Free(G)$?

\begin{gradedexercise}[\exname{DirectSumCopr}]\label{ex:DirectSumCopr}
(7 points) Let $\CatC$ denote the category of real vector spaces. Given real vector spaces $\Obja = (V_1, +_1, \cdot_1)$ and $\Objb = (V_2, +_2, \cdot_2)$, we define their \emph{direct sum} $\Obja \oplus \Objb$ as follows. 
The underlying set of $\Obja \oplus \Objb$ is the cartesian product of the underlying sets of $\Obja$ and $\Objb$, namely $V_1 \times V_2$. For $\Obja \oplus \Objb$, vector addition is defined (using infix notation) by
$$(\ela_1, \ela_2) + (\elb_1, \elb_2) := (\ela_1 +_1 \elb_1, \ela_2 +_2 \elb_2) \quad \quad \ela_1, \elb_1 \in V_1; \ \ela_2, \elb_2 \in V_2;$$
and scalar multiplication is defined (using infix notation) by
$$\lambda \cdot (\ela_1, \ela_2) := (\lambda \cdot_1 \ela_1, \lambda \cdot_2 \ela_2), \quad \quad \lambda \in \reals; \ \ela_1 \in V_2; \ \ela_2 \in V_2.$$

Prove that the direct sum of real vector spaces -- together with inclusion morphisms which you should specify -- is ``the'' categorical coproduct in the category $\CatC$.

\begin{gradedexercise}[\exname{RelKleisli}]\label{ex:RelKleisli}
(13 points) Let $\Set$ denote the category of sets and $\powerset : \Set \to \Set$ the powerset functor which assigns, to any given set $\setA$, the set of subsets of $\setA$. The endofunctor $\powerset$ may be equipped with the structure of a monad $(\powerset, \eta, \mu)$, where the components of the natural transformations $\eta$ and $\mu$ are given, respectively, by the functions
$$ \eta_{\setA} : \setA \to \powerset \setA, \ \ela \mapsto \{ \ela \}$$
and
$$ \mu_{\setA} : \powerset \powerset \setA \to \powerset \setA, \ \sigma \mapsto \bigcup_{S \in \sigma} S.$$

\begin{enumerate}
\item (2 points) Prove that $\eta$, as defined above, is in fact a natural transformation. 
\item Let $\Set_{\powerset}$ denote the Kleisli category of the monad $(\powerset, \eta, \mu)$. The aim of this part of the exercise is to show that the category $\Set_{\powerset}$ and the category $\Rel$ of sets and relations are isomorphic as categories. Your tasks are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item (8 points) Define functors $\funa: \Set_{\powerset} \to \Rel$ and $\funb: \Rel \to \Set_{\powerset}$ and prove that they are in fact functors. 
\item (3 points) Prove that $\funa$ is an isomorphism of categories, with inverse $\funb$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
