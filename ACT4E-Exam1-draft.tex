%Exam date: 27.08.2021 \\
%Exam time: 10:00 -- 11:30  (1.5 hours) \\ 
%Exam place: HG E 7 \\
%Allowed materials: open book (laptops, phones, internet?)
%
%\
%
%\noindent
%Aims of the exam: 
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Test familiarity with and understanding of basic definitions from the course
%\item Test proficiency in basic mathematical skills relating to proving statements, reasoning, and problem-solving
%\item Test the understanding of interconnections between various concepts introduced in the course, and the ability to transfer knowledge
%\item Test the understanding of the "compositional way of thinking" and the use of category theory concepts in connection with applied examples
%\end{enumerate}
%
%\
%
%\noindent
%Desired properties of the exam: 
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Have more questions than are expected by any average or slightly above average student to be solved in the given 1.5 hours (we can then grade on a curve), in order to account for uncertainty in how difficult we judge the exam to be. 
%\item On the other hand we should not have too too many questions, because otherwise the grading work will be disproportionally large in proportion to the number of students. 
%\item Include some multiple choice questions as a way to provide students with a quick means to gain points and to reduce correction work. 
%\item Include some problems that ask for mathematical proofs. 
%\item Include some problems that have an applied flavor. 
%\item Include at least one problem that is challenging and requires some creative problem solving. 
%\end{enumerate}

\begin{gradedexercise}[\exname{StringDiagrams}]\label{ex:StringDiagrams} (6 points) 

The following is a string diagram which can be interpreted to represent a composition of morphisms (having certain types) in any given monoidal category $\tup{\CatC,\mtimescat,\idmoncat}$. The resulting morphism is one of the type $\Obja \to \Objc$. 

\begin{equation}\label{ExamStringDiagram1}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{pics/ExamStringDiagram1.png}
\end{equation}

In this exercise, we will specify three different monoidal categories, and in each case we will also specific objects and morphisms to plug into the variables $\Obja, \Objb, \Objc$ and $\mora, \morb$ in this diagram. Your task is to then compute the morphism that results from composing the morphisms as dictated by the diagram. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item (2 points) In this part of the exercise, let $\tup{\CatC,\mtimescat,\idmoncat}$ be the monoidal category where $\CatC$ is the category $\Set$ of sets and functions, $\mtimescat$ is the cartesian product of sets and functions, and $\idmoncat$ is a chosen $1$-element set that we denote by $\{ * \}$. In the string diagram \cref{ExamStringDiagram1} above, let $\Obja = \mathbb{Z}$, $\Objb = \mathbb{N}$, and $\Objc = \mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, let $\mapa: \{ * \} \rightarrow \Objb$ be the function with $\mapa(*) = 5$, and let $\mapb : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}, \tup{y, x} \mapsto x + y$. Compute the composite morphism described by the string diagram \cref{ExamStringDiagram1} in this case.  

\

\item (2 points) In this part, now let $\tup{\CatC,\mtimescat,\idmoncat}$ be the monoidal category where $\CatC$ is the category $\Rel$ of sets and relations, $\mtimescat$ is the cartesian product of sets and relations, and $\idmoncat$ is a chosen $1$-element set that we again denote by $\{ * \}$. In the string diagram \cref{ExamStringDiagram1}, let $\Obja = \mathbb{Z}$, $\Objb = \mathbb{Z}$, and $\Objc = \mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, let $\mapa: \{ * \} \mto \mathbb{Z}$ be the relation
$$
\mapa = \{ \tup{*, \elb} \in \{ *\} \times \mathbb{Z} \mid \elb \text{ is an even number.} \}
$$
and let $\mapb : \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \mto \mathbb{Z}$ be the relation
$$
\mapb = \{ \tup{\tup{\elb, \ela}, \elc} \in (\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}) \times \mathbb{Z} \mid \ela = \elb = \elc \}.
$$

Compute the composite morphism described by the string diagram \cref{ExamStringDiagram1} in this case.  

\

\item (2 points) In this part, let $\tup{\CatC,\mtimescat,\idmoncat}$ be the monoidal category where $\CatC$ is the category of real vector spaces and real linear maps, $\mtimescat$ is the direct sum, and $\idmoncat$ is the $0$-dimensional real vector space $\{ 0 \}$. In the string diagram \cref{ExamStringDiagram1}, let $\Obja = \Objb = \Objc = \reals^3$. Furthermore, let $\mapa: \{ 0 \} \rightarrow \reals^3$ be the linear function with $\mapa(0) = 0$, and let $\mapb : \reals^3 \oplus \reals^3 \rightarrow \reals^3, \tup{y, x} \mapsto x + y$. Compute the composite morphism described by the string diagram \cref{ExamStringDiagram1} in this case. 

\

\item[$\star$ 4.] (2 points) Let $\tup{\CatC,\mtimescat,\idmoncat}$ be the monoidal category where $\CatC$ is the category of real vector spaces and real linear maps, $\mtimescat$ is the tensor product, and $\idmoncat$ is the $1$-dimensional real vector space $\reals$. In the string diagram \cref{ExamStringDiagram1}, let $\Obja = \Objb =  \reals^3$ and $\Objc = \reals$. Let $\mapa: \reals \rightarrow \reals^3$ be the linear function with $\mapa(1) = \tup{1,1,1}$, and let $\mapb : \reals^3 \otimes \reals^3 \rightarrow \reals$ be the linear map with $\mapb (v \otimes w) = v\cdot w$, where the latter expression denotes the dot product (inner prodcut) of the vectors $v$ and $w$. Compute the composite morphism described by the string diagram \cref{ExamStringDiagram1} in this case.

\begin{gradedexercise}[\exname{DirectSumCopr}]\label{ex:DirectSumCopr} (7 points) 


Let $\CatC$ denote the category of real vector spaces. Given real vector spaces $\Obja = (V_1, +_1, \cdot_1)$ and $\Objb = (V_2, +_2, \cdot_2)$, we define their \emph{direct sum} $\Obja \oplus \Objb$ as follows. 
The underlying set of $\Obja \oplus \Objb$ is the cartesian product of the underlying sets of $\Obja$ and $\Objb$, namely $V_1 \times V_2$. For $\Obja \oplus \Objb$, vector addition is defined (using infix notation) by
$$(\ela_1, \ela_2) + (\elb_1, \elb_2) := (\ela_1 +_1 \elb_1, \ela_2 +_2 \elb_2) \quad \quad \ela_1, \elb_1 \in V_1; \ \ela_2, \elb_2 \in V_2;$$
and scalar multiplication is defined (using infix notation) by
$$\lambda \cdot (\ela_1, \ela_2) := (\lambda \cdot_1 \ela_1, \lambda \cdot_2 \ela_2), \quad \quad \lambda \in \reals; \ \ela_1 \in V_1; \ \ela_2 \in V_2.$$

Prove that the direct sum of real vector spaces -- together with inclusion morphisms which you should specify -- is ``the'' categorical coproduct in the category $\CatC$.

\begin{gradedexercise}[\exname{ComposingDesignProblems}]\label{ex:ComposingDesignProblems} (5 points) 


Consider the following posets, given in terms of Hasse diagrams:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Obja_1$ (speed):

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{pics/ExamDPPoset1.png}
\end{center}

\item $\Obja_2$ (size):

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{pics/ExamDPPoset2.png}
\end{center}

\item $\Objb$ (money):

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{pics/ExamDPPoset3.png}
\end{center}

[@ GZ: replace cheap, mid-price, and expensive with 20'000 CHF, 40'000 CHF, and 120'000 CHF, respectively (or anything half-way realistic, I have no idea! :D)]

\item $\Objc$ (time): 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{pics/ExamDPPoset4.png}
\end{center}
\end{itemize}
Furthermore let $\Obja := \Obja_1 \times \Obja_2$, equipped with the standard product partial ordering. 

Consider the design problem given by the monotone function 
\begin{equation}
\mapa: \Obja^{op} \times \Objb \to \Bool
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{align*}
&\mapa(\tup{ \text{slow}, \text{small}}, \text{cheap}) = \true, \\
&\mapa(\tup{ \text{slow}, \text{large}}, \text{mid-price}) = \true \\
&\mapa(\tup{ \text{fast}, \text{small}}, \text{expensive}) =  \true, \\
&\mapa \text{ evaluates to } \false \text{ in all other cases},
\end{align*}
as well as the design problem given by the monotone function 
\begin{equation}
\mapb: \Objb^{op} \times \Objc \to \Bool
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{align*}
&\mapa( \text{cheap}, \text{short}) = \true \\
&\mapa(\text{mid-price}, \text{long}) = \true, \\
&\mapb \text{ evaluates to } \false \text{ in all other cases}.
\end{align*}

\begin{enumerate} 
\item (3 points) Compute the series composition $\mapa \then_\DP \mapb$ in the category of design problems. The result should be a design problem described in terms of a monotone function $\Obja^{op} \times \Objc \to \Bool$.
\item (2 points) We interpret the elements of $\Obja$ as properties of cars that someone named Alice is considering buying. The elements of $\Objb$ we interpret as different amounts of money that she might need to buy said cars, and the elements of $\Objc$ are amounts of time Alice might need in order to save different amounts of money. We interpret $\mapa$ and $\mapb$, respectively, as the feasibility relations the describe what is possible for Alice. According to the feasibility relation $\mapa \then_\DP \mapb$, is it feasible for Alice to buy a fast small car? If yes, how long will she have to work, at minimum, to save enough money to buy it?
