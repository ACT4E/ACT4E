# Examples

In this folder "examples" you will find 4 examples of KaoBook layouts,
each demonstrating different publications.
* documentation
* machine\_learning\_project
* minimal\_book
* minimal\_report

The PDF files provided with the individual examples show the appearance 
of the respective end product.

NOTE: These examples are not yet complete in this form.
They must be supplemented by two additional components:
* the "styles" folder
* the file that defines the layout type (Book or Report / kaobook.cls or 
  kaohandt.cls)

To make it more clear:
you have to add "kaohandt.cls" for machine\_learning\_project and
to minimal\_report, because these examples are of type "report".
"kaobook.cls" should be included to the two other examples.
