\chapter{Instructions for instructors}


\section{Infrastructure}

\subsection{Repositories}
There are 3 repositories involved:
\begin{compactenum}
  \item \str{ACT4E/ACT4E-exercises} - a \textbf{public} repository.
  This contains the Python interfaces, or ``problem statements''.
  \item \str{ACT4E/ACT4E-exercises-template} - a \textbf{public} repository.
  This is the repository that the students need to clone and work inside.
  \item \str{ACT4E/ACT4E-private} - a \textbf{private} repository.
  This contains the solutions to the exercises, plus all the test infrastructure that allows
  the students to test the solution.
\end{compactenum}

To do development, these repositories need to be checked out inside the book repository.

\subsection{Workflow for code}

\subsubsection{Workflow for students}

From the point of view of the student, this is the workflow:

\begin{compactenum}
  \item Fork \str{ACT4E/ACT4E-exercises-template}. If they use Github Classroom
  then this step will be done for them.
  \item Work on the exercises inside this repository.
  \item To evaluate the exercises type \mintinline{console}{make check-<exercise>}.
\end{compactenum}

The evaluation is done by Docker. In particular these are the steps:

\begin{compactenum}
  \item The instructors have generated a certain Docker image \evalrepo and published to DockerHub (explained later in  \cref{{subsub:developers}}). This image contains only binaries, so the user cannot see the source code for the tests or our reference implementation.
  \item The \files{Dockerfile} inside \str{ACT-exercises-template} build from \evalrepo. It adds more dependendencies
  that the user might have declared in \files{requirements.txt}.
  \item The original repo \evalrepo contains the tester \files{act4e-tests}. In the \files{Makefile}, you can see how
  we pass the group of tests to be called to that executable.
\end{compactenum}
\begin{minted}[autogobble,firstline=2,lastline=3]{console}
\begin{verbatim}
check-%: build
  docker run -it --rm $(tag) act4e-tests --module act4e_solutions --group $*
\end{verbatim}
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Workflow for developers}\label{subsub:developers}

A complete rebuild of the code is done through these steps.

(At this point Andrea is the only one to be able to do this, because of various
credentials issues.)

\begin{compactenum}
  \item Commit and push what is on \str{ACT4E-exercises} to the current branch.

  \item In \str{ACT4E-private} type \str{make build}. This creates and pushes the \evalrepo.
\end{compactenum}

\subsection{Workflow for book creation}\label{sub:book-creation}

There is now some smartness in how the book is created. For example, we are able
to pull directly the Python code into the book. This needs external programs and some configuration.

At this point this is something that only Andrea can do as the things are not well packaged.
