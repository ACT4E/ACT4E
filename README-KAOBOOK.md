Clone this repo:

    https://github.com/ACT4E/kaobook

so that it is in the directory 

    /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/local/kaobook

Then do this:

    sudo mktexlsr

Now our fork of kaobook should be available for the class.


TODO:

* There are a lot of "caption lost" errors from floatrow. Not sure why the captions are not formatted well.

* Had to disable the parttoc, minitoc. Need to find a way to re-enable.
