When one thinks about Switzerland, one of the symbols that comes to mind is usually cows.
Recent statistics show that Switzerland has around 1.6 million cows (roughly one cow per five residents).
The canton of Bern leads the rankings, being the one owning the most cows.
Interestingly, in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden, the ratio of cows and humans is close to 1:1.
