The ``Contra dam'' is commonly known as the ``Verzasca dam'' and is an arch dam on the Verzasca river, in Ticino, Switzerland.
The dam, which supports a large hydroelectric power station, is 220 m tall and 380 m long.
Fun fact: the dam appeared in James Bond's 1995 GoldenEye movie, in which a stuntman performed bungee jumping in the opening scene.
