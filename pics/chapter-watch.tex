Switzerland produces timepieces since the 14th century.
Indeed, a ``Swiss made'' watch is very unique: according to official rules, the mechanics, casing, and inspection of a watch must be carried out in Switzerland to earn the hallmark.
Today, Switzerland is the world's largest watch exporter, counting over 60,000 employees and exporting over \$ 13.7 billion worth products.
