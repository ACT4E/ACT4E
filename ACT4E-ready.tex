% % \begin{abstract}
%     This paper is about engineering design and
%     category theory: an odd couple, consisting of one of the most concrete and
%     one of the most abstract fields of human knowledge.
%     We will show how category theory can help in defining, understanding, and
%     solving formal engineering design problems.
%     This theory is especially well-suited for
%     heterogeneous components with complex
%   recursive co-design constraints.


%     This paper is written for two audiences: we
%     want to explain to engineers the power and the necessity of the
%     category-theoretical language to describe complex design problems; and we
%     want to call the mathematicians' attention to the correspondence between
%     very abstract category theory and extremely concrete engineering design
%     choices that are observable in any artefact.


%     For the reader who already knows category theory: We introduce a category~$\DP$ of
%     \emph{design problems} and study its properties. We show that~$\DP$ is a
%     generalization of the category~$\textbf{Rel}$ of relations.  Diagrams
%     in~$\DP$ describe the co-design constraints among different subsystems of a
%     large system. We show that~$\DP$ is \emph{compact closed}, which makes the
%     diagrams easy to manipulate as they behave similarly to other formalisms
%     such as signal flow diagrams. Finally, we describe the 2-category structure
%     of~$\DP$, which models naturally the dominance between alternative designs.
