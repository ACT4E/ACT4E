\begin{definition*}[External and internal hom]
  {}
  The set $\Hom_\CatC(A,B)$ of morphisms between $A$ and $B$ is known as the \emph{external hom}, and is canonically defined for every category \CatC. For certain categories, however, there is also an \emph{internal hom} $[A,B] \in \CatC$ which satisfies
  \begin{equation*}
    {}
    \Hom_\CatC(A,B) \simeq \{ f : \One \to [A,B] \},
  \end{equation*}
  where $\One$ is the monoidal unit in \CatC; we say that $\Hom_\CatC(A,B)$ is the set of \emph{generalized elements} of $[A,B]$.\end{definition*}
