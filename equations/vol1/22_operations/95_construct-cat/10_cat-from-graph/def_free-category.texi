\begin{definition*}[Free category on a graph]
  {}
  Let~$G=(V,A,s,t)$ be a graph. The \emph{free category on~$G$}, denoted~$\Free(G)$, has as objects the vertices~$V$ of~$G$, and given vertices~$x\in V$ and~$y\in V$, the morphisms~$\Free(G)(x,y)$ are the paths from~$x$ to~$y$.
  The composition of morphisms is given by concatenation of paths, and for any object~$x \in V$, the associated identity morphism~$\id_x$ is the trivial path which starts and ends at~$x$.\end{definition*}
