\begin{definition*}[Twisted arrow category]{}
  {}
  Given a category \CatC, we denote its \emph{twisted arrow category} by~$\TwistedArrow{\CatC}$. This is a category which is composed of:
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item \emph{Objects:} Arrows (morphisms) in \CatC.
    \item \emph{Morphisms:} A morphism between two arrows~$\mora\colon \Obja \mto \Objb $,~$\morb\colon \Objc \mto \Objd$ is given by a pair of arrows~$\tup{\morc,\mord}$ such that the following diagram commutes:
    \begin{center}
      \includesag{180_twistedarrow}
    \end{center}
    \item \emph{Composition:} Composition in~$\TwistedArrow(\CatC)$ is given by playing commutative squares side by side.
  \end{compactenum}\end{definition*}
