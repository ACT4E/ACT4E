\begin{definition*}[\Cat{Tup}]
    {}
    There exists a category \Tup that consists of the following constituents:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item \emph{Objects}: The objects of~\Tup are lists of sets.
        \item \emph{Morphisms}: The morphisms of~\Tup are maps between tuples.
        A morphism from $[a_1, \dots, a_p]$ to $[b_1,\dots, b_q]$ is a $q$-tuple
        of morphisms $[f_1, \dots, f_q]$ where $f_i: a_1 \times \cdots \times a_n \to b_i$.
        \item \emph{Identity morphism}: The identity morphism are the products in sets.
        \item \emph{Composition operation}: Composition is given by function composition in the obvious way.
    \end{compactenum}\end{definition*}
