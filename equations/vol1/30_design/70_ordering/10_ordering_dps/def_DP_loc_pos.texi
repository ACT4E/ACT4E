\begin{definition*}[Order on~\DP]
  {}

  Suppose that~$A$ and~$B$ are posets, and that~$f,g \colon \F{A} \profto \R{B}$ are design problems. We say that~$f$ \emph{implies}~$g$, denoted~$f \posDPleq g$, if~$f(\F{a}^*,\R{b}) \ordleq g(\F{a}^*,\R{b} )$ in~\Bool, for all~$\F{a} \in \F{A}$
  and~$\R{b} \in \R{B}$. In other words, if the fact that~$f$ is feasible implies that~$g$ is feasible. We diagrammatically represent the relation~$f \posDPleq g$ as in~\cref{fig:dpimplies}.\end{definition*}
