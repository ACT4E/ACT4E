\begin{definition*}[Complete Lattice]
    {}
    A poset~$\posA=\tup{\posAset,\posleq}$ is a \emph{\iindex{complete lattice}} if every subset~$\posB$ of~$\posA$ has both a \emph{greatest lower bound} (often referred to as the \emph{infimum, meet}) and a \emph{least upper bound} (often referred to as the \emph{supremum, join}) in~$\tup{\posAset, \posleq}$.\end{definition*}
