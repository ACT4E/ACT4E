\begin{definition*}[Design Problem]
    {}
    A \iindex{design problem} (DP) is a tuple~$\tup{\funsp, \ressp, \adp}$, where~$\funsp, \ressp$ are posets and~$\adp$ is a monotone map of the form
    \begin{equation*}
        {}
        \adp \colon  \funsp\op \Ctimes \ressp \toinPos \Bool.
    \end{equation*}
    We will also use the notation~$\adp \colon \funsp \profto \ressp$ for design problems, in order to emphasize how we think of them as morphisms. This will be explained below.\end{definition*}
