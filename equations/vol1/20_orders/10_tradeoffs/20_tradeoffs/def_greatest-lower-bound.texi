\begin{definition*}[Lower bounds in a poset]
    {}
    The \emph{lower bounds} of a subset~$\setA$ of a poset~$\posA$ are, if they exist, the elements which are dominated by all elements in~$\setA$.
    The \emph{greatest lower bound}, if it exists, is the greatest among the lower bounds of~$\setA$.
    This is denoted~$\meet \setA$ or~$\Inf \setA$ and also called the \emph{meet} or \emph{infimum} of~$\setA$.\end{definition*}
