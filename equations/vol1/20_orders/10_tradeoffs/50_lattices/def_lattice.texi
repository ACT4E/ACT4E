\begin{definition*}[Lattice]
  {}
  A \emph{lattice} is a poset~$\tupp{\posA,\posAleq}$ with some additional properties:
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item Given two points~$\ela, \elb \in \posA$, it is always possible to define their least upper bound, called \emph{join}, and indicated as~$\ela \join \elb$.
    \item Given two points~$\ela, \elb \in \posA$, it is always possible to define their greatest lower bound, called \emph{meet}, and indicated as~$\ela \meet \elb$.
  \end{compactenum}\end{definition*}
