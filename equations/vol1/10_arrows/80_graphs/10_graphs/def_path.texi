\begin{definition*}[Path]
    {}
    Let~$\graph$ be a graph. A \emph{path} in~$\graph$ is a sequence of arrows such that the target of one arrow is the source of the next.
    The \emph{length} of a path is the number of arrows in the sequence.
    We also formally allow for sequences made up of ``zero-many'' arrows (such paths therefore have length zero).
    We call such paths \emph{trivial} or \emph{empty}. If paths describe a journey, then trivial paths correspond to ``not going anywhere''.
    The notions of source and target for arrows extend, in an obvious manner, to paths.
    For trivial paths, the source and target always coincide.\end{definition*}
