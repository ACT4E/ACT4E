This specifies~$f$ as a function that, given a~$\setA$, provides a function that, given a~$\setB$, provides a~$\setC$;
this is the same as a function that needs the two arguments~$\setA$ and~$\setB$ before giving the~$\setC$.
To describe the isomorphism we can write it as
\begin{equation}
>>>>>>> 9245a1c40c490be4ca2e3d19ed04530cab182214
  \setA \to ( \setB \to \setC) \simeq  \setA \cartprod \setB \to \setC\end{equation*}
