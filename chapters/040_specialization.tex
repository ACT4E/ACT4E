\subsubsection{Databases, sets, functions}

We continue the discussion of \cref{def:relational-databases}.

In the particular case of tables with primary keys,
things are easier. In relational databases, 
a table column is a primary key if the values of that column are guaranteed to be unique.

If the values in the column are unique, the column serves as the name of the row. In the table 
above the motor ID serves as the primary key.

Consider a table with columns $P \times X_1 \times X_2 \times \cdots X_n$,
where $P$ is the primary key column. Then, given a key $p \in P$,
we can obtain the value in the other columns. We first find the unique
row with the key $p$, and then we read out the values. 

Therefore, a table with columns $P \times X_1 \times X_2 \times \cdots X_n$
can be seen as a tuple $\tup{S, \{f_i\}_i}$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A subset $S \subseteq P$ that gives us the available keys.
    \item $n$ read-out functions $f_i: P \to X_i$, each giving the 
    corresponding value of the $i$-th attribute.
\end{itemize}

\end{table}
\end{comment}


In this example, we can consider the primary key to be the set
\begin{equation*}
M \coloneqq \{ \textsf{1204}, \textsf{1206}, \textsf{1207}, \textsf{2267}, \textsf{2279}, \textsf{1478}, \textsf{2299} \},
\end{equation*}
of models of motors, as well as the set~$C \coloneqq \{ \textsf{SOYO}, \textsf{Sanyo Denki}\}$ of manufacturing companies, the set $S$ of possible motor sizes, the set~$W$ of possible weights, the set $J$ of possible maximal powers, and the set~$P$ of possible prices. Each attribute of a motor may be thought of as a function from the set~$M$ to set of possible values for the given attribute. For example, there is a function~$\textsf{Company}\colon M \to C$ which maps each model to the corresponding company that manufactures it. So, according to Table \ref{tab:electric_motors}, we have \text{e.g.}~$\textsf{Company}(\textsf{1204}) = \textsf{SOYO}$, and~$\textsf{Company}(\textsf{2279}) = \textsf{Sanyo Denki}$, etc.

Note that in ``real life'', the catalogue of motors might not have seven entries, as in \cref{tab:electric_motors}, but has in fact hundreds of entries, and is implemented digitally as a database, \text{i.e.} a collection of interrelated tables. In this case, we will want to be able to search and filter the data based on various criteria. Many natural operations on tables and databases may be described simply in terms of operations with functions. We will use this setting as a way to introduce compositional aspects of working with sets and functions, and a preview of how this might be useful for thinking, in particular, about databases.

Sticking with \cref{tab:electric_motors}, suppose, for instance, that we want to consider only motors from Company~$\textsf{Sanyo Denki}$. In terms of the function
\begin{equation*}
\textsf{Company}\colon M \to C
\end{equation*}
this corresponds to the preimage~$\textsf{Company}^{-1}(\{ \textsf{Sanyo Denki} \}) = \{ \textsf{2279}, \textsf{2299}\}$, which is a subset of the set~$M$. Or, we may want to consider only motors which cost between 40 and 200 USD. In terms of the obvious function
\begin{equation*}
\textsf{Price}\colon M \to P,
\end{equation*}
this means we wish to restrict ourselves to the preimage
\begin{equation*}
\textsf{Price}^{-1}(\{ 49.95, 59.95, 164.95\}) = \{ \textsf{1478}, \textsf{2299}, \textsf{2279} \} \subseteq M.
\end{equation*}

Now suppose we wish to add a column to our table for ``volume'', because we may want to only consider motors that have, at most, a certain volume. For this we define a set~$V$ of possible volumes (let's take~$V = \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, the non-negative real numbers), and define a function
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\textsf{Multiply}\colon S &\to V\\
\tup{l, w, h} &\mapsto l \cdot w \cdot h,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
which maps any size of motor to its corresponding volume by multiplying together the given numbers for length, width, and heigth.  Now we can compose this function with the function
\begin{equation*}
\textsf{Size}\colon M \to S
\end{equation*}
to obtain a function
\begin{equation*}
\textsf{Volume}\colon M \to V,
\end{equation*}
which defines a new column in our table. The composition of functions is usually written as~$\textsf{Volume} = \textsf{Multiply} \ \circ \ \textsf{Size}$, however we stick to our convention of writing~$\textsf{Volume} = \textsf{Size} \then \textsf{Multiply}$. Schematically, we can represent what we did as a diagram (\cref{fig:diagram_functions}).

%We call such a diagram \textbf{commutative}, because the composition $\mathsf{Size} \then \mathsf{Multiply}$ is equal to the function $\mathsf{Volume}$ (in fact, we defined $\textsf{Volume}$ this way).


\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includesag{40_dpcatfig_data_comm_diag}
\end{center}
\caption{A diagram of functions. \label{fig:diagram_functions}}
\end{figure}

We can interpret the arrows in this diagram as being part of a category, one where $M$,~$S$, and~$V$ are among the objects, and where the functions~$\textsf{Size}$, $\textsf{Multiply}$ and~$\textsf{Volume}$ are morphisms. We probably want to consider the other sets associated with our database as also part of this category, and the other functions which we defined so far, too. One idea might be to just include all the sets and functions that we've defined so far, as well as all possible compositions of those functions, and obtain a category (maybe call it $\textsf{Database}$?) in a way that is similar to how one can build a category from a graph (\cref{sec:catsfromgraphs}). This would be an option. However, we may want soon to add new sets and functions to our database framework, or think about new kinds of functions between them that we had not considered before. And we might not want to re-think each time precisely which category we are working with.


\subsection{The Category Set}

A helpful concept here is to think of our specific sets and functions as living in a very (very) large category which contains all possible sets as its objects and all possible functions as its morphisms. This category is know as the category of sets, and it is an important protagonist in category theory. We will denote it by $\textsf{Set}$. It is a short exercise to check that the following does indeed define a category.

\begin{ctdefinition}[Category of sets]
The category of sets~$\Set$ is defined by:
    \begin{compactenum}
    \item \emph{Objects}: all sets.
    \item \emph{Morphisms}: given sets~$X$ and~$Y$, the homset~$\Hom_\Set(X,Y)$ is the set of all functions from~$X$ to~$Y$.
    \item \emph{Identity morphism}: given a set~$X$, its identity morphism~$\text{id}_X$ is
    is the identity function~$X \to X, \ \text{id}_X(x) = x$.
    \item \emph{Composition operation}: the composition operation is the usual composition of functions.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{ctdefinition} 



We did say above, however, that we could build a category (let's call it \textsf{Database}) that only involves the sets that we are using for our database, and the functions between them that we are working with. What we would need for \textsf{Database} to be a category is that if any function is in \textsf{Database}, then also its sources and target sets are, and we would need that any composition of functions in \textsf{Database} is again in \textsf{Database}. (Also, we define the identity morphism for any set in \textsf{Database} to be the identity function on that set.) If these conditions are met, \textsf{Database} is what is called a \emph{subcategory} of the category of Sets. Here is the general definition. 


\subsection{Notion of subcategory}
 
\begin{ctdefinition}[Alternative definition of subcategory (adapted from 2.6.1 in ...)]
A subcategory $\CatD$ of a category $\CatC$ is a category for which:
\begin{compactenum}
    \item All the objects in $\Ob_\CatD$ are in $\Ob_\CatC$ and all the morphisms in $\Hom_\CatD$ are morphisms in $\Hom_\CatC$;
    \item The source and target of a morphism in $\CatD$ are the same as its source and target in $\CatC$. For any objects $A,B\in \Ob_\CatD$, $\Hom_\CatD(A,B)\subseteq \Hom_\CatC(A,B)$;
    \item If $A\in \Ob_\CatD$, then $\id_A\in \Hom_\CatC(A,A)$ is in $\Hom_\CatD(A,A)$;
    \item If $f\colon A\to B$ and $g\colon B\to C$ in $\CatD$, then the composite $f\then g$ in $\CatC$ is in $\CatD$ and represents the composite in $\CatD$.
\end{compactenum}
\end{ctdefinition}

\begin{ctdefinition}[Subcategory]
\label{def:subcategory}
	Given a category~$\Cat{C}$, a \emph{subcategory}~$\Cat{B}$ consists of a subcollection of the collection of objects and morphisms of~$\Cat{C}$ such that:
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item If a morphism~$f \colon x\to y$ is in $\Cat{B}$, then so are the objects~$x$ and~$y$.
	\item If the morphisms~$f\colon x\to y$ and~$g\colon y\to z$ are in~$\Cat{B}$, then so is their composite~$f\then g\colon x\to z$.
	\item If~$x$ is in~$\Cat{B}$, then so is the identity morphism~$\text{id}_x$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{ctdefinition} 


\todo{[INSERT SOME BRIDGING TEXT HERE]}


\begin{lemma}
    The category~$\Set$ is a subcategory (\cref{def:subcategory}) of~$\Rel$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We need to prove the conditions presented in \cref{def:subcategory}.
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item If a morphism of~$\Rel$ $f \colon X\to Y$ is in~$\Set$, then so are the objects~$X$ and~$Y$. Both~$\Rel$ and~$\Set$ have sets as objects. If a morphism~$f\colon X\to Y$ of~$\Rel$ is in~$\Set$, then a relation~$F\subseteq X\times Y$ between set~$X$ and set~$Y$ exists. This relation can be expressed in~$\Set$ as~$f\colon X\to Y$ and hence the objects~$X$ and~$Y$ exist.
	\item Two morphisms~$f\colon X\to Y$ and~$g\colon Y\to Z$ in~$\Rel$ are relations~$F\subseteq X\times Y$,~$G\subseteq Y\times Z$. If they are in~$\Set$, they can be written as functions~$f\colon X\to Y$ and~$g\colon Y\to Z$ and their composition is in~$\Set$ as well. 
	\item If an object of~$\Rel$ $X$ is in~$\Set$, then so is the identity morphism~$\text{Id}_X$. This is true: for every object~$X$ of~$\Set$ there exists the identity morphism~$\text{Id}_X\colon X\to X$. The diagonal morphism can be expressed as~$\text{Id}_X\colon X\to X$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
$\FinSet$ is the category of finite sets and all functions between them. While an object $X\in \Ob_\Set$ is a set with arbitrary cardinality, $\Ob_{\FinSet}$ only includes sets $X'$ with finitely many elements, i.e., with cardinality $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Objects of $\FinSet$ are in $\Set$, but the converse is not true. Furthermore, given $X,Y\in \Ob_\FinSet$, we know that $X,Y\in \Ob_+\Set$ and $\Hom_{\FinSet}(X,Y)=\Hom_{\Set}(X,Y)$.
\end{example}

\subsection{Drawings}

\newcommand{\Draw}{\Cat{Draw}}

\begin{definition}
There exists a category $\Draw$ in which:
\begin{compactenum}
\item An object in $\alpha\in \Ob_\Draw$ is a black-and-white drawing,
that is a function $\alpha : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \Bool$.
\item A morphism in $\Hom_{\Draw}(\alpha, \beta)$ between two drawings
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ is an invertible map $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ such that
$\alpha(x) = \beta(f(x))$.
\item The identity function at any object $\alpha$ is the identity map 
on $\mathbb{R}^2$. 
\item Composition is given by function composition. 
\end{compactenum}
\end{definition}
 
\todo{add figure here}

We can now think about the different types of transformations. 



Category of Infinite Drawings

Objects are maps from R2 -> Bool 

Morphisms are invertible transformations of the plane. 

Among these we can define subclasses:

0) invertible transforations
1) Affine invertible transformations

2) Rototranslations

3) Scalings 
3) Translations

\todo{in the following let's use $\mathbb{R}$}
\subsubsection{InjSet forms a subcategory of $\Set$}
\begin{definition}[Injective  function]\label{def:injective-function}
Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a function. The function $f$ is \emph{injective} if $f(x)=f(x')\implies x=x'$, $x,x'\in X$.
\end{definition}

\todo{write better/ask JL to proofread}
\begin{example}
We can define a category $\Cat{InjSet}$ which has the same objects as $\Set$ but restricts the morphisms to be \emph{injective functions}.
We want to show that $\Cat{InjSet}$ is a subcategory of $\Set$. Composition and identity morphisms are defined as in $\Set$.

Since $\Ob_{\Cat{InjSet}}=\Ob_{\Set}$, condition (i) of \cref{def:subcategory} is satisfied. To check (ii), consider two $f\in \Hom_\Set(A,B)$, $g\in \Hom_\Set(B,C)$ such that $f\in \Hom_\Cat{InjSet}(A,B)$ and $g\in \Hom_\Cat{InjSet}(B,C)$. We know that given $a,a'\in A$, $f(a)=f(a') \Leftrightarrow a=a'$ and $b,b'\in A$, $g(b)=g(b') \Leftrightarrow b=b'$ from the injectivity of $f,g$. Furthermore, we have:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
    (f\then g)(a)=(f\then g)(a')&\implies f(a)=f(a')\\
    &\implies a=b,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
which proves condition (ii) of \cref{def:subcategory}, i.e. that the composition of injective functions is injective.
\end{example}




\begin{definition}[Continuous functions]
Let $f\colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ be a function. We call $f$ \emph{continuous} at $c\in \mathbb{R}$ if $\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=f(c)$; $f$ is continuous over $\mathbb{R}$ if the condition is satisfied for all $c\in \mathbb{R}$.

\begin{example}
We can define a category $\Cat{Cont}$ which $\Ob_\Cat{Cont}=\mathbb{R}$ and in which the morphisms are given by continuous functions. Composition and identity are as in $\Cat{Set}$.  We want to show that $\Cat{Cont}$ is a subcategory of $\Set$.

\begin{definition}[Differentiable functions]
A function $f\colon U\subset \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$, defined on an open set $U$, is \emph{differentiable} at $a\in U$ if the derivative
\begin{equation}
    f'(a)=\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}

\begin{equation}
    \vert f(x_1)-f(x_2)\vert \leq \kappa \vert x_1-x_2\vert.

\subsubsection{Generalization outside of R}
Generalization to more general spaces. 
We used the fact thath R is:

\item For defining continuous functions, we used the fact that R is topological space (minimum needed for defining a continuous function.). In fact, the real definitoin of continuous function is:

\item To define Lipschitz we needed the fact that R is a metric space 
\item For differentiable, smooth, you define this on Manifolds. Exists tangent space. 
\end{itemize}

the objects to be the same. However we will see later that you can generalize this notion using functors.
