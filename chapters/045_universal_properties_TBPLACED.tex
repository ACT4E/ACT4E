\section{Universal properties}


\JL{I think this might be a good place to introduce universal properties via initial and terminal objects (and in particular using the examples of Set and Rel)}

\begin{ctdefinition}[Initial and terminal object]
Let~\CatC be a category and let~$A \in \CatC$ be an object. We say that~$A$ is an \emph{initial object} if, for all~$B \in\CatC$, the hom-set~$\Hom_\CatC(A,B)$ has exactly one element. We say that~$A$ is a \emph{terminal object} if, for all~$D\in\CatC$, the hom-set~$\Hom_\CatC(D,A)$ has exactly one element.
\end{ctdefinition}
