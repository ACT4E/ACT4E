\section{Monotonicity and fixed points\label{sec:Monotonicity-and-fixed}}

We will use Kleene's theorem, a celebrated result that is used in
disparate fields. It is used in computer science for defining denotational
semantics~(see, e.g.,~\cite{manes86}). It is used in embedded systems
for defining the semantics of models of computation~(see, e.g.,~\cite{lee10}).

\begin{definition}[Directed set]
  A set~$S\subseteq\posA$ is \emph{directed} if each pair of elements
  in~$S$ has an upper bound: for all~$a,b\in S$, there exists~$c\in S$
  such that~$a\posleq c$ and~$b\posleq c$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Completeness]
  \label{def:cpo}A poset is a \emph{directed complete partial order}
  (\DCPO) if each of its directed subsets has a supremum (least of
  upper bounds). It is a \emph{complete partial order} (\CPO) if it
  also has a bottom.

\end{definition}
\begin{example}[Completion of $\nonNegReals$ to~$\nonNegRealsComp$]
  \label{exa:Rcomp}The set of real numbers~$\mathbb{R}$ is not
  a \CPO, because it lacks a bottom. The nonnegative reals~$\nonNegReals=\{x\in\reals \colon x\geq0\}$
  have a bottom~$\bot=0$, however, they are not a \DCPO because some
  of their directed subsets do not have an upper bound. For example,
  take~$\nonNegReals$, which is a subset of~$\nonNegReals$. Then~$\nonNegReals$
  is directed, because for each~$a,b\in\nonNegReals$, there exists~$c=\max\{a,b\}\in\nonNegReals$
  for which~$a\leq c$ and~$b\leq c$. One way to make~$\left\langle \nonNegReals,\leq\right\rangle $
  a \CPO is by adding an artificial top element~$\top$, by defining~$\nonNegRealsComp\triangleq\nonNegReals\cup\{\top\},$
  and extending the partial order~$\leq$ so that~$a\leq\top$ for
  all~$a\in\reals^{+}$.
\end{example}

A property of maps that will be important are monotonicity and
the stronger property of \scottcontinuity.

\begin{definition}[\scottcontinuity]
  \label{def:scott}A map~$f:\posA\rightarrow\posB$ between DCPOs
  is\textbf{ }\emph{\scottcontinuous{}}\textbf{ }iff for each directed
  subset~$D\subseteq\posA$, the image~$f(D)$ is directed, and $f(\sup D)=\sup f(D).$
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  \scottcontinuity implies monotonicity.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  \scottcontinuity does not imply topological continuity. A map from
  the CPO $tup{\Rcomp,\leq}$ to itself is \scottcontinuous
  iff it is nondecreasing and left-continuous. For example, the ceiling
  function $x\mapsto\left\lceil x\right\rceil $~ is \scottcontinuous
  (\cref{fig:ceil}).
\end{remark}

\emph{}

A \emph{fixed point} of $f:\posA\to\posA$ is a point~$x$
such that $f(x)=x$.
\begin{definition}
  A \emph{least fixed point} of~$f:\posAto\posA$ is the minimum
  (if it exists) of the set of fixed points of~$f$:
  \begin{equation}
    \lfp(f)\,\,\doteq\,\,\min_{\posleq}\,\{x\in\posA\colon f(x)=x\}.\label{eq:lfp-one}
  \end{equation}
  The equality in \eqref{lfp-one} can be relaxed to ``$\posleq$''.
\end{definition}
The least fixed point need not exist. Monotonicity of the map~$f$
plus completeness is sufficient to ensure existence.
\begin{lemma}[{\cite[CPO Fixpoint Theorem II, 8.22]{davey02}}]
  \label{lem:CPO-fix-point-2}If~$\posA$ is a \CPO and~$f:\posA\rightarrow\posA$
  is monotone, then $\lfp(f)$ exists.
\end{lemma}


With the additional assumption of \scottcontinuity, Kleene's algorithm
is a systematic procedure to find the least fixed point.
\begin{lemma}[{Kleene's fixed-point theorem \cite[CPO fixpoint theorem I, 8.15]{davey02}}]
  \label{lem:kleene-1}Assume $\posA$ is a \CPO, and~$f:\posA\rightarrow\posA$
  is \scottcontinuous. Then the least fixed point of~$f$ is the supremum
  of the Kleene ascent chain
  \[
    \bot\posleq f(\bot)\posleq f(f(\bot))\posleq\cdots\posleq f^{(n)}(\bot)\leq\cdots.
  \]
\end{lemma}
