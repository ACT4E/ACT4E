\todo{Hence we can define this category.}

\begin{ctdefinition}
  There is a category, called \Category, which is constituted of
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Objects: categories;
    \item Morphisms: functors;
    \item Identity morphisms: identity functors;
    \item Composition: composition of functors.
