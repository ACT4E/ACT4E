\section{Opposite of a poset}\label{sec:opposite-of-a-poset}

\begin{definition}\label{def:poset-opposite}
    The \emph{opposite} of a poset~$\tup{A, \ordleq} $ is the poset denoted as~$\tup{A\op, \ordleq\op}$ that has the same elements as~$A$ and the reverse ordering (\cref{fig:opposite}).
    For a given~$x \in A$, we use~$x^*$ to represent its corresponding copy in~$A\op$; note that~$x$ and~$x^*$ belong to distinct posets.
    Reversing the order means that, for all $x,y\in A$,
    \begin{equation}
        x \ordleq y \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad y^* \ordleq\op x^*.
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Credit and debt]
    Let us define the set
    \begin{equation*}
        \stdcurr=\{\$0.00,\$0.01,\$0.02,\dots\}
    \end{equation*}
    of all \stdcurr monetary quantities approximated to the cent.
    From this set we can define two posets:~$\stdcurr^{+} = \tup{\stdcurr, \ordleq}$ and~$\stdcurr^{-} = \tup{\stdcurr, \ordgeq}$, that are the opposite of each other.
    If the context is that, given two quantities~$\$1$ and~$\$2$, we prefer~$\$1$ to~$\$2$ (for example because it is a cost to pay to acquire a component), then we are working in~$\stdcurr^{+}$, otherwise we are working in~$\stdcurr^{-}$ (for example because it represents the price at which we are selling our product).
    Traditionally, in double-entry ledger systems, the numbers were not written with negative signs, but rather in color: red and black. From this convention we get the idioms ``being in the black'' and ``being in the red''.
