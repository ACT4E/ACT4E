\section{A poset as a category}
\label{sec:posetsarecats}
A single poset~$\tup{P, \ordleq}$ can be described as a category, in which each point~$\obja\in P$ is an object, and there is a morphism between~$\obja$ and~$\objb$ if and only if~$\obja \ordleq \objb$. This is a ``thin'' category, wich means that there is at most one morphism
between two objects: For any~$\obja,\objb\in P$, there exist only one relation~$\obja\ordleq \objb$ in~$P$ (\cref{def:poset}). The identity morphism is given by the reflexivity property of posets, i.e. for any~$\obja\in P$, we have~$\obja \ordleq \obja$. Furthermore, composition is given by the transitivity property of posets, i.e. for~$\obja,\objb,\objc \in P$,~$\obja\ordleq \objb$ and~$\objb\ordleq \objc$ implies~$\obja\ordleq \objc$.

\begin{example}
    Let's revisit \cref{ex:hasseinclusion}, in which we had a poset~$\powerset\left(\{a,b,c\}\right)$ with order given by inclusion (\cref{fig:posetascat}).

    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \begin{center}

        \end{center}
        \caption{Power set~$\powerset{\{a,b,c\}}$ as a category. \label{fig:posetascat}}
    \end{figure}

    This is a category~\CatC, with~$\ObC=\powerset\left(\{a,b,c\}\right)$, and morphisms given by the inclusions. Note that we omit to draw self-arrows for the identity morphisms. Composition is given by the transitivity law of posets. For instance, since~$\{a\}\subseteq \{a,b\}$ and~$\{a,b\} \subseteq \{a,b,c\}$, we can say that~$\{a\}\subseteq \{a,b,c\}$.
\end{example}

\subsection{Monotone maps are functors}
Note that morphisms in \Pos are morphisms between posets, and we have just discovered that posets are examples of categories.
\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:posetfunctor}
    A monotone map~$F$ between posets~$P,Q$ is a functor between the ``posetal categories''~$P$ and~$Q$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We start by specifying the functor~$F$ and two posets~$P$ and~$Q$. We first specify the action of~$F$ on objects (elements of a poset) and on morphisms (order relations). A monotone function maps each element of a poset~$p\in P$ to~$F(p) \in Q$, and it guarantees that for every~$p_1,p_2\in P$, if $p_1\ordleq p_2$ then~$F(p_1)\ordleq F(p_2)$. We now need to check the two conditions that a functor must satisfy. First, consider the identity morphism for~$p\in P$, namely~$p\ordleq p$. The application of the map $F$ results in the condition~$F(p)\ordleq F(p)$, which is the identity morphism on~$Q$. Second, morphisms~$p_1\ordleq p_2$ and $p_2\ordleq p_3$ in $P$, by applying the map $F$ to the morphism composition~$p_1\ordleq p_3$ one obtains~$F(p_1)\ordleq F(p_3)$, which is the same as the composition of~$F(p_1)\ordleq F(p_2)$ and~$F(p_2)\ordleq F(p_3)$.
\end{proof}
